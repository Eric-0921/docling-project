5.1.3.2 VXI-11 protocol

The VXI-11 standard is based on the ONC RPC (Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call) protocol which in turn relies on TCP/IP as the network/transport layer. The TCP/IP network protocol and the associated network services are preconfigured. TCP/IP ensures connection-oriented communication, where the order of the exchanged messages is adhered to and interrupted links are identified. With this protocol, messages cannot be lost.
