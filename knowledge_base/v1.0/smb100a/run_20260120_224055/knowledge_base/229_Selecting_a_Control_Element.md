# Selecting_a_Control_Element

Selecting a Control Element

Control elements are always selected in the same way no matter whether a function block in the diagram, a menu in the menu tree, a parameter in the menu or an entry in a list or table is concerned.

To activate an element, put the cursor on it.

An active element is highlighted by a blue frame.
