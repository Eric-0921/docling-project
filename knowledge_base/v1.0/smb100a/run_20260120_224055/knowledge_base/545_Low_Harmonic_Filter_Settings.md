# Low_Harmonic_Filter_Settings

Low Harmonic Filter Settings

In 20 GHz or 40 GHz instruments (option R&S SMB-B120(L) /-B140(L)), you can install a low harmonic filter (option R&S SMB-B25 /-B26), to improve the harmonic performance.

See the website http://www.rohde-schwarz.com/product/smb100a.html or the datasheet for more information on the options available according to the features of your instrument.

For a fitted low harmonic filter, you can define its operating mode in section "Low Harmonic Filter" of the "RF Level / EMF" dialog. Otherwise, the section is hidden.

To access the filter settings, select "RF > Config > RF Level > Low Harmonic Filter".
