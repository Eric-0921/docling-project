# Note:

Note:

You access this generic standard function each time you perform one of the following:

define a folder these files are to be stored in or

store or load (settings) files

navigate through the file system.

The name of the dialog is context sensitive but the provided functions are self-explanatory and very similar.

With the provided settings, you can perform the following:

to load and store files, use the dedicated functions "Select", "Save" and Recent files

to navigate through the file system, use the directory tree

to perform standard file management functions, like create new directories, move, copy, delete files and/or directories, use the standard "File Manager" function (see "File Manager" on page 130).
