# Expected_responses:

Expected responses:

Pressing a key once (green), pressing twice (red)

Pressing the [esc] key a third time exits the dialog.

If you detect a malfunction, for example, you press the front panel key the first time, and the color of the button in the dialog turns red (instead of green), the front panel key may be stuck. In this case, contact the Rohde & Schwarz Customer Support Center for technical support, see www.rohde-schwarz.com/support.
