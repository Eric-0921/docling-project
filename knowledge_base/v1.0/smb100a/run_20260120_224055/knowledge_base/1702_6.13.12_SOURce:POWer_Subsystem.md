6.13.12 SOURce:POWer Subsystem

This subsystem contains the commands for setting the output level, level control and level correction of the RF signal.

Other units can also be used instead of dBm:

by entering the unit directly after the numerical value (example :POW 0.5V )

by changing the DEFault unit in the UNIT system (see the command :UNIT: POWer ).
