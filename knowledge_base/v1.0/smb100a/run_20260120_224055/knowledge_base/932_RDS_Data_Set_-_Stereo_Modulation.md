TA (traffic announcement, marks the start of a traffic program)

PTYN (program type name)

MS (music /speech)

DI (decoder information)

CT (clock time, used for synchronization)

The following values are empty:

AF (alternative frequencies, maximum of five lists with 25 frequencies each, enables the receiver to re-tune to a different frequency providing the same station when the first signal becomes too weak)

RT (radio text, two text blocks with 64 symbols each)

TMC (traffic message channel)

EON (enhanced other networks, eight PS with five EON AF lists each, enables the receiver to automatically tune into these stations if a traffic programs are broadcasted)

The program identification and the program service name of the selected data set are indicated in the menu.
