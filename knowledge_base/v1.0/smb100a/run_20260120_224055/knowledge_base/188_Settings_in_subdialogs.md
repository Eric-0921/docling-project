# Settings_in_subdialogs

Settings in subdialogs

A separate window is opened for each dialog and subdialog. The dialogs can be operated independently of each other, i.e. none of the dialogs requires that settings in other dialogs be completed before it can be closed. This ensures flexible operation at all times.
