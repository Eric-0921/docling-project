Cable selection and electromagnetic interference (EMI)

Electromagnetic interference (EMI) can affect the measurement results.

To suppress electromagnetic radiation during operation:

Use high-quality shielded cables, especially for the following connector types:

-BNC

Double-shielded BNC cables.

How to: "To connect to non-screwable connectors (BNC)" on page 26

-USB

Double-shielded USB cables.

How to: Chapter 3.1.9, "Connecting USB Devices", on page 25.

See Chapter 9.6, "Measuring USB Cable Quality", on page 506.

-LAN

At least CAT6 STP cables.

How to: Chapter 3.1.7, "Connecting to LAN", on page 24

Always terminate open cable ends.

Ensure that connected external devices comply with EMC regulations.
