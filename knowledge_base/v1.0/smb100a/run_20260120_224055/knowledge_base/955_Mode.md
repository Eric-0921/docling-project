# Mode

Mode

Selects the LF frequency sweep mode.

If you change the sweep mode during the execution, the signal generator stops the sweep and starts with the next trigger event at the initial value.

The "Reset Sweep" button sets the sweep to the start value.

"Auto"

Generates a continuously repeating sweep signal immediately after activating the sweep mode.

The sweep steps are performed atomatically, controlled by the dwell time, see "Dwell Time - LF Sweep" on page 230.
