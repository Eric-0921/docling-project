# Modulation_Generator_and_LF_Output

Modulation Generator and LF Output

Generates a single sweep cycle after a trigger event.

The sweep steps within the cycle are performed automatically, controlled by the dwell time. If one cycle is completed, the instrument waits for the next trigger event.

To trigger the sweep, use "Execute Single Sweep" button, or the corresponding remote control commands, for example *TRG .
