:TRIGger<hw>:PSWeep:SOURce <Source>

Sets the trigger source for the RF level sweep.

The names of the parameters correspond directly to the various settings under manual control. SCPI uses other names for the parameters; these names are also accepted by the instrument. The SCPI names should be used if compatibility is an important consideration.

An overview of the various names is given in Table 6-2.
