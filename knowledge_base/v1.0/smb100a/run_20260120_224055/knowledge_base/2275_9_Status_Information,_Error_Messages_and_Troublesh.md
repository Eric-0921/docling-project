9 Status Information, Error Messages and Troubleshooting

The R&S SMB distinguishes between a variety of different messages such as status messages, error messages, warnings, or information that are displayed in the "Info" line on the screen, and also entered in the error/event queue of the status reporting system.

This section describes the information and status messages concerning the operating status of the instrument and the types of error messages and warnings. Some error messages require that the error must be eliminated before correct instrument operation can be ensured. The info window with a list of current messages and a detailed description of each message can be opened with the [INFO] key.

In the remote control mode, error messages are entered in the error/event queue of the status reporting system and can be queried with the command SYSTem:ERRor? . If the error queue is empty, 0 ("No error") is returned. The status reporting system is described in detail in Chapter 5.5, "Status reporting system", on page 273.

Section Chapter 9.5, "Resolving network connection failures", on page 505 provides recommended solutions for network connection errors, and helps you to collect the information required for quick and efficient support.
