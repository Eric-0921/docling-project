ALC States

The following description basically explains the ALC states and their principle of operation. In particular ALC OFF (Sample & Hold) gives an overview on the function in terms of the equipment of the generator.

The R&S SMB offers the ALC states:

AUTO

automatically adjusts the output level to the operating conditions.

On enables ALC permanently, regardless of the currently selected mode.

Off

deactivates ALC.

The instrument switches to Sample & Hold (S&H) state, which still allows to maintain a constant output level.

The following section explains the functionality of "Sample & Hold", to provide an overview and to indicate what is to be considered. "On" and "Auto" require no additional explanation. Furthermore, find the ALC state settings described in detail in State - ALC.
