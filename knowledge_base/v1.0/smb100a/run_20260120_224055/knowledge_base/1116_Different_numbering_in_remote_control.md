# Different_numbering_in_remote_control

Different numbering in remote control

For remote control, the suffix may differ from the number of the corresponding selection used in manual operation. SCPI prescribes that suffix counting starts with 1. Suffix 1 is the default state and used when no specific suffix is specified.

Some standards define a fixed numbering, starting with 0. If the numbering differs in manual operation and remote control, it is indicated for the corresponding command.
