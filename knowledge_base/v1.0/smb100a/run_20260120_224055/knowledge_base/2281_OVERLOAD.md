# OVERLOAD

OVERLOAD

The power of the external signal applied to the RF output is too high. The overload protection is tripped and the connection between the RF output and attenuator is interrupted. The overload protection is reset by pressing the [RF ON/OFF] key. The RF input is activated when the overload protection is reset.
