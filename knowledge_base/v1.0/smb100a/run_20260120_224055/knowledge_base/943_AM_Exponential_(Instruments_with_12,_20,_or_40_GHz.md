# AM_Exponential_(Instruments_with_12,_20,_or_40_GHz

AM Exponential (Instruments with 12, 20, or 40 GHz frequency options)

If you perform exponential AM (AM Type Exponential) with the internal signal of the LF generator, the [LF] output provides the exponential modulation signal.

Using AM Source External, the instrument supplies the distorted external signal. The signal of the internal modulation generator is not available, as well as setting the parameters LF Gen Freq and "LF Gen Shape" on page 206.

The remote commands required to define these settings are described in Chapter 6.13.6, "SOURce:LFOutput Subsystem", on page 354.
