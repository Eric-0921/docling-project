TRIGger Subsystem

The trigger system of the R&S SMB is a simplified implementation of the SCPI trigger system. The TRIGger system differs from the SCPI system as follows:

No INITiate command; the instrument behaves as if INITiate:CONTinuous ON were set.

Under TRIGger several sweep subsystems exist.

Other commands associated with the trigger system of the R&S SMB can be found in the modulation and RF signal subsystems.
