3.1.2 Unpacking and Checking

Unpack the R&S SMB carefully.

Retain the original packing material. Use it to protect the control elements and connectors when transporting or shipping the R&S SMB later. See also "Lifting and carrying" on page 489.

Using the delivery notes, check the equipment for completeness.

Check the equipment for damage. If the delivery is incomplete or equipment is damaged, contact Rohde & Schwarz.
