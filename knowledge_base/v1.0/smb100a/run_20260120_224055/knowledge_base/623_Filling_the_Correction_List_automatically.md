Fill

The start line and the number of rows to be filled are defined under "From" and "Range."

The column to be filled is selected under "Select column to fill". Depending on the selection here, the default for start, end, and increment value are set. As the settings are interdependent, a change of one parameter may result in the automatic change of one or more of the other parameters. The filling of the column with the selected value settings is started with button "Fill".

The correction list entries are only computed when the "Fill" button is pressed.
