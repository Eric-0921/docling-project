Edit Pulse Train Data

Opens an editor allowing you to enter the "On-Time / OFF-Time" value pairs in a table. In addition, you can assign a repetition rate to each pair. Based on these values, the instrument then generates the pulse train signal. You can enter any number of value pairs and save your list in a file. The file name is displayed in the header of the dialog.
