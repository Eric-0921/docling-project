RS232 using USB adapter

Remote control via a serial interface is possible via a USB. The controller and the instrument must be connected with the external USB/serial-adapter R&S TS1-USB (see recommended extras in the data sheet) and a serial crossover (null modem) cable. A USB connection requires the VISA library to be installed on the controller. VISA will detect and configure the R&S SMB automatically when the USB connection is established.

In addtion, you can also use a Bluetooth connection for remote control via the serial interface. The settings are effective for both interfaces (see also Chapter 4.2.3.14, "Security", on page 114 ).
