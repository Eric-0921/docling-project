# [:SOURce<hw>]:POWer:STARt_<Start>

[:SOURce<hw>]:POWer:STARt <Start>

Sets the start level for the RF sweep.

Note: You can select any level within the setting range. The range is defined by this start value and the [:SOURce<hw>]:POWer:STOP value.

A defined offset ( [:SOURce<hw>]:POWer[:LEVel][:IMMediate]:OFFSet ) affects the level values according to the formula:

Minimum level + OFFSet
