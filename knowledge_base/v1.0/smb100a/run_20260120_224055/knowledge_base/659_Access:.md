The dialog shows the settings and measurement values of the sensor selected in the field next to the connector symbol. For indicating the parameters of another sensor, switch to the respective sensor in the selection list.

When you connect your power sensor(s) via the R&S NRP-Z5 USB sensor hub, each channel of the hub is firmly assigned to the associated sensor channel in the generator.

The remote commands required to define the settings are described in Chapter 6.12, "SENSe, READ and INITiate Subsystems", on page 318.
