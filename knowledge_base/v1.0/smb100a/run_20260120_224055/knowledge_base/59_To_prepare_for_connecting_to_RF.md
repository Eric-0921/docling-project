To prepare for connecting to RF

NOTICE! Damaged or not clean connections can lead to RF insertion loss and mismatch, and even premature wear of the connectors.

Before connecting to the port, inspect the RF connector visually to check that it is clean, undamaged and mechanically compatible.

See the application note 1MA99 for information on how to handle and maintain the RF port, to minimize measurement deviations and ensure its longevity.

NOTICE! Risk of instrument damage. Excessive reverse power or DC voltage at the RF connector can damage the instrument. Make sure that the values do not exceed the reverse power and DC limits as given in the data sheet.

If the R&S SMB is switched on, deactivate the RF output, before connecting an RF

cable to the RF connector. In the home screen, select the block "Level" > "RF ON > Off".
