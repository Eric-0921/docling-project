# RF_Mode

RF Mode

Selects the level mode for signal output.

This function allows you, to optimize the RF output signal for applications, where improved harmonic suppression or a low Signal-to-Noise ratio is required.

Instrument Function

RF Block

Note: The modes "Low Distortion" and "Low Noise", for improving harmonic suppression or the S/N ratio require that an attenuator is fitted.

"Normal"

The generator provides an RF output signal with high signal to noise ratio as well as low distortion, according to the data sheet.

"LOW Noise"

"LOW Distortion"

The generator reduces distortion (harmonics) of the RF signal.
