4.5.4.2 Pulse Train Generation

In "Pulse Train" mode, the instrument provides the associated parameters for configuring a user-defined pulse train signal.

A pulse train is a sequence of pulses with user-defined on and off times. The "ON Time / OFF Time" value pairs are defined in a pulse train table and can be stored in a file. The currently loaded file is displayed in the dialog. You can export an internally created pulse train list as well as import an externally created one.

In remote control mode, you must first create a data file, before you switch to pulse train mode. Otherwise you get the error message "No current list" in the "Info" line.
