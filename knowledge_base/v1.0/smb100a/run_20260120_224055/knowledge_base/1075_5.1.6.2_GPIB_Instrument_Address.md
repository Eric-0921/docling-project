5.1.6.2 GPIB Instrument Address

In order to operate the instrument via remote control, it must be addressed using the GPIB address. The remote control address is factory preset, but it can be changed if it does not fit in the network environment. For remote control, addresses 0 through 30 are allowed. The GPIB address is maintained after a reset of the instrument settings.
