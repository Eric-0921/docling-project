# MANual

MANual

The trigger system is not active. Each frequency step of the sweep is triggered individually, either by varying the "Current Frequency" value using the rotary knob under manual control or by means of a FREQ:MAN command under remote control. With manual control, the frequency increases or decreases (depending on the direction of the rotary encoder) by the value specified under FREQ:STEP:INCRement . With remote control, the frequency is set directly with the command :FREQ:MAN .
