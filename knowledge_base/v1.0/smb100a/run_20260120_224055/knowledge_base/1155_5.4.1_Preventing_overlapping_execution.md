5.4.1 Preventing overlapping execution

To prevent an overlapping execution of commands, one of the commands *OPC , *OPC? or *WAI can be used. All three commands cause a certain action only to be carried out after the hardware has been set. The controller can be forced to wait for the corresponding action to occur.

Table 5-5: Synchronization using *OPC, *OPC? and *WAI

Command synchronization using *WAI or *OPC? is a good choice if the overlapped command takes only little time to process. The two synchronization commands simply block overlapping execution of the command. Append the synchronization command to the overlapped command, for example:

SINGle;	*OPC?

For time consuming overlapped commands, you can allow the controller or the instrument to do other useful work while waiting for command execution. Use one of the following methods:
