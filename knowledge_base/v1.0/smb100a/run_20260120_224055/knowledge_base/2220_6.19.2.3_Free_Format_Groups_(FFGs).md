6.19.2.3 Free Format Groups (FFGs)

In the user-definable groups 1A, 3A, 5A, 6A, 7A, 8A, 9A, 10A, 11A, 12A and 13A, any desired data can be transmitted. Five bits of this data are transmitted in block B and 16 bits each in blocks C and D of the specified group.

Define the data to be transmitted in group 1A: STEReo:DIRect "1A=05,0000000000,1FFFFFFFFF"

Group 1A is now transmitted first with "0000000000" and then with "1FFFFFFFFF". Each of the two data sequences is retransmitted five times, which is indicated by the information "05".

Set the group sequence, e.g.:

STEReo: DIRECT "GS=0A, 1A"
