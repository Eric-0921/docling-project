General Instrument Settings

Indicates the number which is used in the automatically generated file name.

Note: When initially switching on the instrument the number is reset to the lowest possible value. Starting with number 0 the output directory is scanned for already existing files. As long as files with the same name are existing the number is increased by 1. The number is automatically set so that the resulting file name will be unique within the selected path. The current number is not in the save/recall file but will be temporarily stored within the database. At following save operations the number is increased.
