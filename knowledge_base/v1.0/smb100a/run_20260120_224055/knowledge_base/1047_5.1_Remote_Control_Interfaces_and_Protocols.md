5.1 Remote Control Interfaces and Protocols

The instrument supports different interfaces for remote control. The following table gives an overview.

Table 5-1: Remote control interfaces and protocols

* ) VISA is a standardized software interface library providing input and output functions to communicate with instruments. A VISA installation on the controller is a prerequisite for remote control over LAN (when using VXI-11 or HiSLIP protocol), USB and serial interface. For remote control via socket communication VISA installation is optional. For more information, see Chapter 5.1.1, "VISA Libraries", on page 241.

Rohde & Schwarz provides the standardized I/O software library R&S VISA for communication via TCP/IP (LAN: HiSlip, VXI-11 and raw socket) or USB (USBTMC) interfaces.

R&S VISA is available for download at the Rohde & Schwarz website http:// www.rohde-schwarz.com/rsvisa.

How to configure the remote control interfaces, see Chapter 5.2, "Starting a Remote Control Session", on page 249.
