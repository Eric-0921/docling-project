External Modulation Sources

The modulation input [MOD EXT] at the instrument front provides the external modulation sources for amplitude, frequency and phase modulation.

The external audio signal for stereo modulation is input via the analog [L] and [R] inputs or via the digital [S/P DIF] interface at the rear of the instrument.

The external modulation signal for AM, FM and PM at the input must have a voltage of US = 1 V (U EFF = 0.707 V) in order to achieve the displayed modulation depth and range. The input voltage should not exceed 1 V, otherwise modulation distortions might occur.
