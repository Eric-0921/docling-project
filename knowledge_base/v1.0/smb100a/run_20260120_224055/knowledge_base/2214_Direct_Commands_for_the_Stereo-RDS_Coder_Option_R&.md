Direct Commands for the Stereo/RDS Coder Option R&S SMB-B5

The frequencies of an AF list are entered one after the other; the frequency currently transmitted has to be specified as the first frequency.

Method B:

The frequencies of an AF list are entered in pairs, each pair containing the frequency currently transmitted and an alternative frequency. The frequency pairs should normally be entered in ascending order. Descending order should be chosen only if the alternative frequencies belong to different regions or are used to broadcast different programs at different times.

Do not combine methods A and B!
