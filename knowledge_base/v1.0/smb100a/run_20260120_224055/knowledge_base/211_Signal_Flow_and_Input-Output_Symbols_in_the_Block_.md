Signal Flow and Input/Output Symbols in the Block Diagram

The input/output symbols in the block diagram show the currently used inputs and outputs of the signal generator. Unused inputs and outputs are not shown. The lines indicate the signal flow.

Symbols and labels refer to the corresponding inputs and outputs on the front and rear panel of the signal generator. The direction - input or output - is indicated by an arrow.
