Remote command:

[:SOURce<hw>]:PULM:TRAin:OFFTime on page 400

"Count"

Sets the number of repetitions for each pulse ("ON-Time/ μ s"/"OFFTime/ μ s" value pair).

Tip: If you set "Count = 0", the corresponding value pair is ignored in the pulse sequence. With this function you can skip value pairs individually, without deleting them from the table. This allows re-enabling a value pair by entering a number unequal to zero.
