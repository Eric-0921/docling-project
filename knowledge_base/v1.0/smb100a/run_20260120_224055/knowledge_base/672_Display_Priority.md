# Display_Priority

Display Priority

Determines whether the instrument displays the measured average or the peak power permanently on the screen.

To select the peak power display, it is required that the R&S NRP power sensor supports this feature. On power-on or connecting a sensor the average power value is set by default.

To enable the permanent display in the block diagram, select Permanent Display State.
