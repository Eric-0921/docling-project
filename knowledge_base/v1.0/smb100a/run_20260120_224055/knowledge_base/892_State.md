State

Activates pulse modulation.

When the internal modulation source (pulse generator) is selected, the pulse generator is switched on automatically and the video/sync signal is output at the [PULSE VIDEO] output at the rear of the instrument. Signal output can be switched off in the "Pulse Generator" dialog (see Chapter 4.5.4, "Pulse Generator", on page 231).
