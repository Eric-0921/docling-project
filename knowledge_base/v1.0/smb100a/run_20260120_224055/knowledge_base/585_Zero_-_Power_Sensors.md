Zero - Power Sensors

Activates the auto zero function.

Zeroing calibrates the external power sensor by adjusting its reading at zero signal power. For this purpose, the RF power source must be switched off or disconnected from the sensor. If a Rohde & Schwarz power sensor receives an input power during the zeroing process, it aborts zeroing and generates an error message. Zeroing takes a few seconds, depending on the sensor model. Refer to the documentation of your power sensor for more information.
