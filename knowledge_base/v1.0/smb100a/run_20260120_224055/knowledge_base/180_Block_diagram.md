Block diagram

The block diagram is the core of the operating concept.

A graphics display shows the current configuration and the signal flow in the form of a block diagram. All graphical elements can be accessed for operation. An element is selected by means of the arrow keys and the associated setting function is called by pressing Enter. Required menus and graphs are displayed on the block diagram which is displayed again in the foreground whenever the [DIAGRAM] ([CTRL+D]) key is pressed.

The main characteristics of the RF signal, frequency and level, are permanently displayed in the header section of the screen and can be directly set in the display fields after the [FREQ] (CTRL+F) or [LEVEL] (CTRL+L) key is pressed. Status messages for the output signal are displayed in addition to frequency and level.
