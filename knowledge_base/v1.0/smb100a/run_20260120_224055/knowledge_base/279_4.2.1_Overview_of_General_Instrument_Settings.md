4.2.1 Overview of General Instrument Settings

This section describes the settings which do not directly affect signal generation. Most of these settings can only be accessed by means of menus which are opened using keys or key combinations on the external keyboard or keys on the front panel key emulation.

The general instrument settings therefore affect various functions, such as storing instrument settings using the [FILE] key or setting the GPIB address in the menu of the [SETUP] key. The order in which the descriptions are given corresponds to the layout of the keys on the front panel of the R&S SMB (from top left to bottom right).
