Instrument Function

General Instrument Settings

To transfer files from and to the instruments or to exchange files, use one of the following alternatives:

Connect a memory stick to one of the USB interfaces. The instrument recognizes automatically a connected memory stick.

Connect the instrument to a LAN. For information on how to set up a LAN connection, refer to Chapter 3.1.7, "Con-

necting to LAN", on page 24 .

An instrument connected to a LAN supports the standard file transfer methods from a remote client:

-FTP (file transfer protocol)

see "To access the file system of the R&S SMB via ftp" on page 134

-File sharing according to the SAMBA/SMB (server message block) protocol see "To access the file system of the R&S SMB via SMB (Samba)" on page 135

Both file transfer methods access the folder /var/user/share .

This section provides an introduction to this topic. For comprehensive information, refer to the Application Note 1GP72 "Connectivity of Rohde&Schwarz Signal Generators".
