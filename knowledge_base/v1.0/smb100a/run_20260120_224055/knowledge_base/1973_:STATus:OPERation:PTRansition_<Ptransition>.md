# :STATus:OPERation:PTRansition_<Ptransition>

:STATus:OPERation:PTRansition <Ptransition>

Sets the bits of the PTRansition part of the STATus:OPERation register. If a bit is set, a transition from 0 to 1 in the condition part causes an entry to be made in the EVENt part of the register. A new event in the hardware is thus registered, for example the start of an adjustment.
