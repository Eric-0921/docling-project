9.1 Status Information

The status messages are displayed in the header section of the screen. The status information gives the user an overview of the main operating states and settings of the instrument. The states are indicated for information only and do not necessitate any action by the user. Status information is displayed between the frequency and level fields, at the left of the info line or in the info line itself.
