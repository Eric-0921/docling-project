User Correction Settings

The "User Correction" settings are set in the most lower section of the combined dialog; this section is used to activate/deactivate user correction, and to create, select and activate the lists.

The upper section provides access to the automatic level control settings, see Chapter 4.3.5.4, "Automatic Level Control - ALC", on page 153.
