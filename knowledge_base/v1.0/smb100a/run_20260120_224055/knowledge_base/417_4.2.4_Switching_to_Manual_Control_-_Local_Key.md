4.2.4 Switching to Manual Control - Local Key

The local key switches from remote control to manual control (local state).

In remote control mode the instrument indicates the remote state in the display header. The rest of the display remains unchanged and shows the current instrument status, that means the status which exists under the remote control settings. The instrument can be operated (for example dialogs can be opened). However, it is not possible to enter or change values.

The status message additionally indicates whether the [LOCAL] key is disabled or enabled.

The following states are indicated:

"REMOTE"

The [LOCAL] key switches the instrument from remote control to manual control. The current command must be fully processed before the mode is switched, otherwise the instrument switches immediately back to remote control.

"REM-LLO"

The [LOCAL] key is locked, inititated by the &LLO (local lockout) command. The instrument can be switched from remote state to local state only via remote control, for example with &GTR or the Visual Basic command CALL IBLOC (generator%) . The [LOCAL] key has previously been locked by the remote command &LLO .

When switching from remote to manual control, the display update function is automatically deactivated ("SETUP" > "Start/Stop Display Update" > "Off").
