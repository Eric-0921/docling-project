In the upper section of the dialog, the modulation source is selected and the modulation switched on. The modulation source can be selected independently for the different modulation types and the LF output.

The configuration of the selected external and/or internal modulation source is performed in the lower section of the dialog (internal source only).

These settings affect all modulations which use the same modulation sources.

An LF generator and a pulse generator are available as internal sources.
