Messages indicate errors in the instrument. They are displayed in the info line in different colors depending on their importance and display duration. Errors (e.g. no calibration data) are displayed in red, information (e.g. file not found) and warnings in black. Warnings indicate less significant errors (e.g. the instrument operates outside specified data).
