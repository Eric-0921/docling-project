# 5.5.4_Event_status_register_(ESR)_and_event_status

5.5.4 Event status register (ESR) and event status enable register (ESE)

The ESR is defined in IEEE 488.2. It can be compared with the EVENt part of a SCPI register. The event status register can be read out using command *ESR? .

The ESE corresponds to the ENABle part of a SCPI register. If a bit is set in the ESE and the associated bit in the ESR changes from 0 to 1, the ESB bit in the STB is set. The ESE register can be set using the command *ESE and read using the command *ESE? .
