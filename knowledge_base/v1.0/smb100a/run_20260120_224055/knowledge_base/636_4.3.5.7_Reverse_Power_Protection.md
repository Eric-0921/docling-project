4.3.5.7 Reverse Power Protection

The reverse power protection prevents against overload by an external signal applied to the RF output of the R&S SMB.

The R&S SMB equipped with frequency options up to 6 GHz includes a reverse power protection as standard. For instruments equipped with frequency option R&S SMBB112 or R&S SMB-B112L a reverse power protection option R&S SMB-B30 is available. Refer to the data sheet for additional information and the respective option.

The reverse power protection is tripped when the power of the external signal becomes too high. A relay opens and interrupts the internal connection to the RF output. This condition is indicated in the display header by the "OVERLOAD" status message.
