The upper section of the info window contains a list of all current permanent messages in the order of their occurrence, i.e. the most recent message is displayed first. In the lower section of the window, additional information on the highlighted message is displayed. A history of all messages that have occurred since instrument switch-on can be called with the "History" key. The most recent message is displayed first.

The messages are color-coded according to their level. Device-specific messages are red, info and remote control error are black. The level is also indicated in the "Lev" column (Err, Sys or Info). Column "SCPI" indicates the SCPI error code.

With the aid of the softkey buttons, error messages can be cleared and a history of all messages called.
