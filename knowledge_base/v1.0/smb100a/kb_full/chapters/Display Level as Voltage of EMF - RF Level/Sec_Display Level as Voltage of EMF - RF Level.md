# Display Level as Voltage of EMF - RF Level
Activates display of the signal level as voltage of the EMF (no-load voltage). If this setting is deactivated, the level is displayed as a voltage over a 50 Ohm load.

Note: This setting is not affected by an instrument preset ([Preset] key), *RST ) or the "Save/Recall" function. Only the Chapter 4.2.3.16, "Factory Preset", on page 122 resets the setting.
