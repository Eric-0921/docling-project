# Four presetting actions are available:
Activating the default state of all internal instrument functions ( *RST on page 286). Functions that concern the integration of the instrument into a measurement setup are not changed, e.g. GPIB address or reference oscillator source settings.

Activating the preset state of the parameters related to the selected signal path ( : SOURce<hw>:PRESet on page 289)

Activating the preset state of all parameters that are not related to the signal path ( :DEVice:PRESet on page 288)

Activating the original state of delivery (factory reset, :SYSTem:FPReset on page 289). Only functions that are protected by a password remain unchanged as well as the passwords themselves.
