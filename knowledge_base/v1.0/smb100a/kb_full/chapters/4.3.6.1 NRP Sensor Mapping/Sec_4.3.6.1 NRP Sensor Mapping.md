# 4.3.6.1 NRP Sensor Mapping
The "NRP Sensor Mapping" lists all R&S NRP sensors detected by the instrument.

Any R&S NRP sensor that supports the USB legacy protocol and is connected to one of the USB interfaces, is detected automatically and added to the list. Vice versa, the R&S SMB removes a sensor from the list, when it is disconnected.

R&S NRP sensors that are connected via LAN or use the USBTMC protocol are not automatically detected. They are detected by the scan search function.
