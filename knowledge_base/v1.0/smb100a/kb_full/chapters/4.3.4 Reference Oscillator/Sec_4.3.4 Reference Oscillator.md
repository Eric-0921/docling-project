# 4.3.4 Reference Oscillator
The R&S SMB is equipped with an internal reference oscillator that generates a reference frequency of 10 MHz. It is used as internal reference source for the synthesizer and the local oscillator. Alternatively, you can apply an external reference signal.

Regardless of the used reference source (internal or external), the R&S SMB always provides the configured reference frequency at the output. You can use it, for example to synchronize several interconnected instruments.

The settings of the reference oscillator are not affected by an instrument preset ("PRESET" key).
