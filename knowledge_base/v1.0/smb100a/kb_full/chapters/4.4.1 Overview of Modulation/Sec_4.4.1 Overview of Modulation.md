# 4.4.1 Overview of Modulation
Analog modulation is a method used to transmit information of an LF (Low Frequency) signal in accordance with a second signal, typically one of a higher frequency. This is done by varying one or more properties of a high frequency waveform, called the modulation or carrier signal, with the modulating signal that contains the information to be transmitted.

The three key parameters of the modulation signal are the amplitude, phase and frequency. These parameters are modified in accordance with the low frequency signal to obtain the modulated RF signal.

R&S ® SMB100A

Instrument Function

Modulation

The R&S SMB provides the following types of modulation:

AM (Amplitude Modulation)

FM (Frequency Modulation)

PhiM (Phase Modulation)

PULM (Pulse Modulation)

Stereo Modulation

In addition, the RF signal can be modulated with various internally generated modulation waveforms, like sine or rectangular signal waves. The basic unit (R&S SMB + frequency option) provides amplitude, frequency and phase modulation without additional equipment options, as well as a standard LF generator provided for internal modulation. Further available options are:

R&S SMB-B5, Stereo/RDS Coder for performing stereo modulation

R&S SMB-K21, Pulse Modulation for instruments with high frequency options

R&S SMB-K22, Pulse Modulation for instruments equipped with frequency-options up to 6 GHz

R&S SMB-K23, Pulse Generator for pulse signals

R&S SMB-K27 Pulse Train for generating pulse train signals (only for instruments with serial number higher than 102400)

Settings for the modulation are made in separate modulation menus. These menus can be accessed in the block diagram by way of the "Modulation" function block, or by means of the menu with the same name which is opened using the [MENU] key.
