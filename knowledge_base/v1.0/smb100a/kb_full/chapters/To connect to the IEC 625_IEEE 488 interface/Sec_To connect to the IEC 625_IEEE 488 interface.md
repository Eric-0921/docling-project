# To connect to the IEC 625/IEEE 488 interface
You can use the GPIB bus interface for controlling the instrument remotely. The "IEC 625/IEEE 488" connector is at the rear panel.

Connect the "IEC 625/IEEE 488" socket to the controller PC with a double-shielded GPIB bus interface cable.

Configure the settings for remote control over GPIB. The controller must address the instrument with the GPIB bus address.

For details, refer to Chapter 5.1.6, "GPIB Interface (IEC/IEEE Bus Interface)", on page 246 and Chapter A.1, "GPIB Bus Interface", on page 508.
