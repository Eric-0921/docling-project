# Structure of the Dialogs
The parameters are set in the menus. Menus are accessed either via the function blocks in the diagram or by means of the [MENU] (CTRL+M) key. The menus are displayed on top of the block diagram.

The [WINBAR] key toggles between the active menus. The [REARR] key toggles between the enlarged and normal sized menus.

Working with menus and dialog boxes is described in Chapter 3.5.1.4, "Accessing Dialogs", on page 76; the setting of parameters in Chapter 3.5.1.5, "Setting Parameters", on page 77.

The menus are in Windows format. The menus differ in details depending on their function but they consist of the same main elements. Each menu consists of a menu header and one or more menu areas with various fields for setting parameters.

The header line contains the name of the menu and the buttons for minimizing and closing the menu. To operate the buttons, use the mouse or the front key [CLOSE] (ESC).

Several fields of associated but separately set parameters are organized in menu areas. A menu area is framed and labelled with the function common to all parameters.
