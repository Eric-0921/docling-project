# 3.5.2 Remote Control
Remote control is an operation of the instrument by means of remote control commands or programs that automatize repeating settings. The instrument is connected to a computer running the program.

The R&S SMB supports various remote control connections:

Connecting the instrument to a (LAN) network

Using the LXI browser interface in a LAN network

Connecting a PC via the IEC-bus (IEEE 488) interface

Remote control via the USB interface

Tip: For remote control over LAN or USB, you can use the R&S VISA (Virtual Instrument Software Architecture) library provided for download at the Rohde & Schwarz website http://www.rohde-schwarz.com/rsvisa.

This way of operation and the instructions how to set up a connection for remote control are described in the Chapter 5, "Remote Control Basics", on page 240. The description of the remote control commands is provided in Chapter 6, "Remote Control Commands", on page 283.
