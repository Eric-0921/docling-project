# Filling the List Mode Data automatically
The "Fill List Mode Data" menu enables you to automatically set the values in the List Mode table.

The start line and the number of rows to be filled are defined under "From" and "Range".

The column to be filled is selected under "Select column to fill". Depending on the selection here, the default for start, end, and increment value are set. As the settings are interdependent, a change of one parameter may result in the automatic change of one or more of the other parameters.

The filling of the column with the selected value settings is started with button "Fill".

The list entries are only computed when the "Fill" button is pressed.
