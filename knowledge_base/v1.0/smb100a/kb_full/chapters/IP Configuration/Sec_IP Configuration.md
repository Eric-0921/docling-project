The "IP Address Mode" selects a configuration mode for the IP address of the R&S SMB. With static configuration, the entered IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway are used. With dynamic configuration, DHCP or dynamic link local addressing (automatic IP) are used to obtain the instrument IP address.

See Chapter 3.1.15.1, "Assigning the IP Address", on page 30.
