# Tips for zeroing
When to perform zeroing:

After a substantial change of the ambient temperature

During warm up after switching on or connecting the instrument

After fastening the power sensor module to an RF connector at high temperature

When low-power signals are to be measured, e.g. less than 10 dB above the lower measurement limit.

After several hours of operation

Switch off the RF power source for zeroing, but do not disconnect it from the power sensor. This proceeding keeps the thermal equilibrium, and the zeroing process also compensates the noise that superimposes the measured signal (e.g. from a broadband amplifier).
