# Mode - Stereo Modulation
Selects the mode for the audio signal. If the internal LF generator is selected as audio source, the signal is generated according to the selection here. For external signals, the signal type has to be entered.

"Mono Left"

A mono signal containing the left channel is generated/fed in.

"Mono Right"

A mono signal containing the right channel is generated/fed in.

"Stereo R=L"

A stereo signal with right and left channel is generated/fed in. The channels have the same frequency and phase.

"Stereo R=-L"

The signal on the left external audio input is used for both channels, left and right. The right channel is inverted.

"Stereo R!=L"

(External source only)

A stereo signal containing different, independent right and left chan- nels is fed in. It is possible, for example, to feed a fixed audio fre- quency to the first channel while a frequency sweep is being per- formed in the second channel.
