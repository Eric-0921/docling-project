# Mod Gen block
The internal modulation sources are configured in this block. Also, the "LF frequency sweep" can be activated here.

An internal LF generator is available as the internal source for the analog modulations AM, FM and PHiM. Available modulation shapes are sine and rectangle.

The internal modulation signals are provided at the LF output at the front of the instrument. The LF output signal and the modulations sources for the analog modulations AM, FM and PhiM can be selected independently from each other.

A pulse generator provides single and double pulse modulation with selectable pulse widths and periods. Additionally, an option is available to generate pulse train signals.

The R&S SMB offers three different sweep types (frequency sweep, level sweep and LF sweep) to be activated alternatively. Each type has 6 modes which differ with respect to the sweep cycle mode (continuous, individual and step-by-step) and triggering mode (automatic, internal and external). In the "Mod Gen" block, the LF sweep is configured. Frequency and level sweep settings are accessed via the "RF" block.
