# 5.5.4 Event status register (ESR) and event status enable register (ESE)
The ESR is defined in IEEE 488.2. It can be compared with the EVENt part of a SCPI register. The event status register can be read out using command *ESR? .

The ESE corresponds to the ENABle part of a SCPI register. If a bit is set in the ESE and the associated bit in the ESR changes from 0 to 1, the ESB bit in the STB is set. The ESE register can be set using the command *ESE and read using the command *ESE? .

|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|         0 | Operation Complete This bit is set on receipt of the command *OPC exactly when all previous commands have been executed.                                                                                                                                                                       |
|         1 | Not used                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|         2 | Query Error This bit is set if either the controller wants to read data from the instrument without having sent a query, or if it does not fetch requested data and sends new instructions to the instrument instead. The cause is often a query which is faulty and hence cannot be executed. |
|         3 | Device-dependent Error This bit is set if a device-dependent error occurs. An error message with a number between -300 and -399 or a positive error number, which denotes the error in greater detail, is entered into the error queue.                                                        |
|         4 | Execution Error This bit is set if a received command is syntactically correct but cannot be performed for other reasons. An error message with a number between -200 and -300, which denotes the error in greater detail, is entered into the error queue.                                    |
|         5 | Command Error This bit is set if a command is received, which is undefined or syntactically incorrect. An error message with a number between -100 and -200, which denotes the error in greater detail, is entered into the error queue.                                                       |
|         6 | User Request This bit is set when the instrument is switched over to manual control.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|         7 | Power On (supply voltage on) This bit is set on switching on the instrument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
