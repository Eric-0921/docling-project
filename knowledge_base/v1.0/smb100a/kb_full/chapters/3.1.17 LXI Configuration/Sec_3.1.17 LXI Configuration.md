# 3.1.17 LXI Configuration
LXI ("LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation" is an instrumentation platform for measuring instruments and test systems that is based on standard Ethernet technology. LXI is intended to be the LAN-based successor to GPIB, combining the advantages of Ethernet with the simplicity and familiarity of GPIB.

Like GPIB, LXI determines and standardizes the way the instrument behaves in a LAN. The LXI implementation by the Rohde&Schwarz signal generators allows you to change certain LAN settings, to reset the LAN connection as well as to identify the instrument easily.
