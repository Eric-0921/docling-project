# How to execute internal adjustments
NOTICE! Adjustments can be invalid if performed when the instrument is not warmed-up.

Wait until the instrument has reached its operating temperature before you start the adjustment procedure.

The warm-up time is up to 30 minutes.

NOTICE! During level adjustments instruments without step attenuator, that means with frequency options R&S SMB-BxxxL, temporarily apply high power at the RF output. This high power can damage the DUT. Therefore, it is required that the RF connector is terminated during the adjustments.

Disconnect the DUT. Replace it by a 50 Ohm terminating resistor.

Press the [setup] key.

Select "System > Internal Adjustments > Adjust All".

Before the internal adjustment starts, a warning message prompts you to make sure that you have terminated the RF.

If the termination resistor is missing, a second warning message appears.

During adjustments, a progress indicator shows the status of the process. If any error occurs, the process aborts and an error message appears in the info line.

Proceed the same way for further adjustments the instrument provides.
