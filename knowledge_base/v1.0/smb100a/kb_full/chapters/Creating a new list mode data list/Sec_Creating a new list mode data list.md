# Creating a new list mode data list
A new list can be created under a new name either by generating a blank file in the "File Select" menu (see section Chapter 3.5.1.8, "File Management", on page 86) or by changing an existing list which will then be saved under a new name.

To create an empty data list, select "RF > List Mode > List Mode Data... > New List" or respectively "RF > User Correction > User Cor. Data... > New User Correction Data" and enter the file name of the new data list.

To open the data list for editing, select the associated button "Edit User Correction Data..." or "Edit List Mode Data..." in the individual menu. Edit the list and save it under a new name.
