# FM Deviation
Sets the modulation deviation in Hz.

The maximum deviation depends on the RF frequency and the modulation mode (see data sheet).

Note that you can set a deviation that is too high for a specific RF frequency, or set an RF frequency outside of the adjustable range of the deviation. In both cases, the instrument sets the maximum deviation and displays an error message.

In "Int + Ext" modulation source mode, the instrument devides the deviation into half for each source.
