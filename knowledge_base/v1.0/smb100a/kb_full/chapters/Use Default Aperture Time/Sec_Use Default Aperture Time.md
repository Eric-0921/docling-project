# Use Default Aperture Time
Enables you to specify a user-defined aperture time for the respective sensor.

The sensor default setting is usually sufficient. If however, the readings vary, it is recommended that you adjust the aperture time exactly to one modulation period, in order to obtain stable readings. To specify the aperture time, see Aperture Time.
