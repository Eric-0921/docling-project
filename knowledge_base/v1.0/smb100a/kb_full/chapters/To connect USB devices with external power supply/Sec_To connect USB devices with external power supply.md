# To connect USB devices with external power supply
NOTICE! Connected devices with external power supply can feed back current into the 5 V power supply of the USB interface and thus damage the R&S SMB. Ensure that there is no connection between the positive pole of the power supply and the +5 V power pin of the USB interface (VBUS).

Connect the USB storage device to the USB type A connector at the rear panel.
