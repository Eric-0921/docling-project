# :CALibration<hw>:LEVel:EXTern:DATA <Data>
Queries what data has been used for the level calibration.

By default the instrument uses correction data obtained in the factory before delivery. In addition, customer data can be used for external level correction. The customer data is obtained using a R&S NRP power sensor. External level correction is a protected function (see service manual, chapter 2, "Adjustment").
