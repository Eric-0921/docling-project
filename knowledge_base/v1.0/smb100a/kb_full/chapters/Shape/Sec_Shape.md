"Sawtooth"

The sweep runs from the start to the stop frequency. Each subsequent sweep starts at the start frequency, that means the shape of the sweep sequence resembles a sawtooth.

"Triangle"

The sweep runs from start to stop frequency and back, that means the shape of the sweep resembles a triangle. A subsequent sweep starts at the start frequency.
