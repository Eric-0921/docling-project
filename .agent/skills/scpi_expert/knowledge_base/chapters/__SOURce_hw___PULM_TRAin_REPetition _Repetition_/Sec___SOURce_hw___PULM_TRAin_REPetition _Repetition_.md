# [:SOURce<hw>]:PULM:TRAin:REPetition <Repetition>
Sets the number of repetitions for each ontime/offtime value pair.

*RST does not affect data lists.

Tip: "0" ignores the corresponding value pair in the pulse train. Thus, you can individually omit value pairs without deleting them from the table.
