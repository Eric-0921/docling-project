# Operation corresponds to the Windows concept
To offer the user a familiar environment, operation is very similar to operation of Windows user interfaces. All menus and tables are made up of known elements, such as selection lists, check boxes and entry fields.

A blue frame indicates that the selected item is active. In the highlighted element, entries can be made.
