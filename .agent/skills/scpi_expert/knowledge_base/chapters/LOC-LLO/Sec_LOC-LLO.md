# LOC-LLO
For the direct operation the state has been changed from remote control to manual operation (local state). The [LOCAL] key was disabled with the command LLO (local lockout).

With the next activating of the remote control mode, the instrument cannot be switched to manual operation by the operator. The status information changes to "REM-LLO".

The instrument can be switched to manual operation by means of remote control only (e.g. with the Visual Basic command CALL IBLOC (generator%) ).
