# Confirming multiple values
In some cases, like for instance when editing data in a user correction table, it is useful first to enter few values and to confirm them together. Such settings require additional confirmation. Not yet confirmed settings are displayed on a yellow background as an indication that the currently displayed values do not represent the target signal.

To confirm these settings, select the "Save" or "Accept" button, respectively.
