# Risk of network errors!
Connection errors can affect the entire network.

If your network does not support DHCP, or if you choose to disable dynamic TCP/IP configuration, you must assign valid address information before connecting the instrument to the LAN.

Contact your network administrator to obtain a valid IP address.

To access this dialog, press the [setup] or [menu] key and select "Environment > Network Settings".

In the "Network Settings" dialog, you can configure the settings of the general network environment and specific identification parameters of the instrument in the network.

The remote commands required to remotely configure the network are described in Chapter 6.15, "SYSTem Subsystem", on page 437.
