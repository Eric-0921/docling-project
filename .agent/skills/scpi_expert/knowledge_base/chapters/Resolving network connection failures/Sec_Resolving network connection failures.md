|          465 | File contains invalid data   | The selected file contains data that is not valid for the file type. The file extension determines the data that is valid for this file type. If the file extension is changed the lists are no longer recognized and the data are therefore invalid. Example: the extension of a wave- form file (= *.wv ) was changed to *.txt | Check the file extension.                                                                                                                                            |
