# RF 50 Ohm
Output for RF signal.

NOTICE! Maximum Input Levels. Do not overload the RF output.

The instrument is equipped with a reverse power protection that prevents the RF output against back feed, see Chapter 4.3.5.7, "Reverse Power Protection", on page 167. Nevertheless, the maximum permisssible reverse power is specified in the data sheet.

Depending on the equipped frequency option, the RF output connectors vary.

NOTICE! Risk of RF connector and cable damage. If you tighten the connectors too strongly, you can damage the cables and connectors. If you do not tighten the connectors enough, the measurement results can be inaccurate.

Always use an appropriate torque wrench suitable for this type of connector and apply the torque specified in the application note 1MA99.

The application notes are available on the Internet and provide additional information on care and handling of RF connectors.

Rohde & Schwarz offers appropriate torque wrenches for various connectors. For ordering information, see the R&S SMB data sheet or product brochure.
