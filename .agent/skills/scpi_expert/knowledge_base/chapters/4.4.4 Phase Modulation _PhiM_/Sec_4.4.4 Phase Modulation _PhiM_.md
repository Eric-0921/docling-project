# 4.4.4 Phase Modulation (PhiM)
![Picture](#/pictures/264)

It is not possible to use phase modulation simultaneously with frequency modulation.

See "Simultaneous Operation of Several Modulations or Other Operating Modes" on page 203 for an overview in detail.

An internal and/or external source can be selected for phase modulation. The [LF GEN] modulation generator is available as the internal source.

The [MOD EXT] input connector for external feed of analog modulation signals is at the front of the instrument. The coupling mode of the input (AC or DC) and the impedance can be selected.

Selection between the following modulation modes is possible:

"Normal" mode with full setting range for modulation bandwidth and PhiM deviation.

"High Deviation" mode with full setting range for PhiM deviation and a reduced setting range for modulation bandwidth. Phase noise is reduced in the lower modulation frequency range compared to the default mode.

"Low Noise" mode with better signal/noise ratio, but reduced setting range for modulation bandwidth and deviation (see data sheet)
