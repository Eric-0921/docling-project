# 4.3.6.2 NRP Power Viewer
The R&S SMB features the power viewer function for measuring or monitoring either the RF output power, or a freely selectable signal source with R&S NRP power sensors.

The instrument can perform up to 4 power measurements simultaneously.

To connect the sensors you have the following options:

connect the sensor directly at a [USB] interface. Requires the following cables, depending on the used sensor type:

-R&S NRP-ZKU (USB interface cable) for R&S NRPxx power sensors

-R&S NRP-Z3 or R&S NRP-Z4 (USB adapter cables) for sensors of the R&S NRP-Zxx family

connect the sensor indirectly via [USB] using the R&S NRP-Z5 USB sensor hub. The R&S NRP-Z5 USB sensor hub (high-speed USB 2.0) can host up to 4 R&S NRP sensors. It provides simultaneous internal and external triggering of all connected sensors.

Requires additional cables, depending on the used output connector of the hub. Choose one of the following:

-Short extension cable R&S NRP-Z2 for connection to the sensor connector. This six-pole connection provides the external trigger capability.

-Standard USB cable (USB type A to USB type B) to any USB type A connector of the R&S SMB. This connection does not support external triggering.

connection the sensor indirectly via USB hub with external power supply unit Requires the following cables, depending on the used sensor type:

-R&S NRP-ZKU (USB interface cable) for R&S NRPxx power sensors

-R&S NRP-Z3 or R&S NRP-Z4 (USB adapter cables) for sensors of the R&S NRP-Zxx family

connect an R&S NRPxxN power sensors via LAN Using the Ethernet interface requires PoE (Power over Ethernet) to provide the electrical power.

To establish the connection, you can use:

-A PoE Ethernet switch, e.g. R&S NRP-ZAP1 and an RJ-45 Ethernet cable.

-A PoE injector and an RJ-45 Ethernet cable.
