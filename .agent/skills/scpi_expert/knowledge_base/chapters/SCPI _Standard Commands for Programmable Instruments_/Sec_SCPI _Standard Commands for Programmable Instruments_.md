# SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments)
SCPI commands - messages - are used for remote control. Commands that are not taken from the SCPI standard follow the SCPI syntax rules. The instrument supports the SCPI version 1999. The SCPI standard is based on standard IEEE 488.2 and aims at the standardization of device-specific commands, error handling and the status registers. The tutorial "Automatic Measurement Control - A tutorial on SCPI and IEEE 488.2" from John M. Pieper (R&S order number 0002.3536.00) offers detailed information on concepts and definitions of SCPI.

Tables provide a fast overview of the bit assignment in the status registers. The tables are supplemented by a comprehensive description of the status registers.
