# Configuring the controller
To remote control the R&S SMB, we use the R&S VISA Tester application.

The instrument is preconfigured for networks using DHCP (dynamic host configuration protocol). If this configuration is used, enter the computer name in the position of the IP address.

To enable the external controller to communicate with the R&S SMB via TCP/IP protocol, set up a remote control link as follows:

Make sure that the controller and the instrument are connected in the network (network cable) and switched on.

On the controller, start "R&S VISA > Tester 32bit" or "R&S VISA > Tester 64bit", respectively.

In the menu bar, select "Choose VISA Implementation > Rohde & Schwarz Visa".
