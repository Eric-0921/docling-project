# REMOTE
Indicates that the instrument is in remote control mode.

The keys on the front panel are usable, but all parameters are in read only mode.

To return to manual control, use the [local] key or the command &GTL . The current command must be fully processed before the mode is switched, otherwise the instrument switches immediately back to remote control.
