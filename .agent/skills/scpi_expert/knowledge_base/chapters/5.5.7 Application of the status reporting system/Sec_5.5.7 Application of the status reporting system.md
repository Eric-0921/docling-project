# 5.5.7 Application of the status reporting system
The purpose of the status reporting system is to monitor the status of one or several devices in a measuring system. To do this and react appropriately, the controller must receive and evaluate the information of all devices. The following standard methods are used:

Service request (SRQ) initiated by the instrument

Serial poll of all devices in the bus system, initiated by the controller to find out who sent an SRQ and why

Query of a specific instrument status by commands

Query of the error queue
