# Editing list mode data lists
To access a list editor and open an existing data list for editing, use the cursor keys to select the associated button "Edit User Correction Data..." or "Edit List Mode Data..." (if available) in the individual menu.

The selected list is displayed and the cursor marks the first row of the "Frequency/Hz" column.

If no list has been selected, a blank list of only one row is displayed.

Press the [Left/Right] arrow keys to change between the colums. Use the [Up/Down] arrow keys to mark a row.

Use the numeric keys to enter the value for the value pairs in the "Frequency/Hz" and "Power/dBm" table columns. A blank row is inserted at the end of the list. Terminate the entry by pressing a [Unit] key.

To select a row, select the "GoTo" button and press the [ENTER] key. Use the numeric keys to enter the row index in the entry field and press the [ENTER] key to confirm the entry.

The cursor moves to the selected row.

To insert a new row in the table, select the row above which the new row is to be inserted and select "Insert Row(s)".

A row is inserted above the currently marked row.

If no row has been selected, a row is inserted at the beginning of the list.

Use the "Save" function to save the edited list under its current name. Enter the file name in the "File Select" dialog and select the directory (see "File Select Dialog" on page 88).

Only complete value pairs are taken into consideration; rows containing an entry in only one column are ignored.
