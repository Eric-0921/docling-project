Modulation

"High Deviation"

The maximum range for ɸ M deviation is available. Phase noise is improved for low frequencies compared to the default mode. The range of modulation frequency is limited (see data sheet). This mode is recommended for low modulation frequencies and/or high PhiM deviation.

"Low Noise"

Phase modulation with phase noise and spurious characteristics close to CW mode. The range for modulation bandwidth and PM deviation is limited (see data sheet).
