# Directory and File Name
Selects the directory in which the file to be deleted or copied is located. The dialog lists all files in this directory. Selected files are highlighted. The path is indicated above the directory window.

Unlike the "Save/Recall" and "File Select" dialogs, the "File Manager" displays the full file names including extensions.
