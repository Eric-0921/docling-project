The available drives and directories and the files of the selected directory are displayed. The currently selected path is displayed above the window. Only the relevant files without file extensions are displayed. If the area is opened several times, the path last selected is displayed. When a file is saved or created, its name is user-selectable; the extension is assigned automatically and cannot be entered. The file is saved to the selected path.

In addition to the files saved by the user, some menus also offer files containing predefined contents. These files are saved to a specific directory on system drive; for this reason, this directory cannot be chosen from the "File Select" menu.
