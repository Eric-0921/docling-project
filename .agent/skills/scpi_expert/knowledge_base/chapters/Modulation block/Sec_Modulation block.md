# Modulation block
The internal and external analog modulations are configured and activated in this block. The [MOD ON/OFF] key switches the active modulation(s) on/off.

The internal modulation sources are configured in the "Mod Gen" block. External amplitude, frequency or phase modulation signals can be fed in at the input connector [MOD EXT] at the front of the instrument. An external pulse signal is fed in via the BNC connector [PULSE EXT] at the rear of the instrument. AC or DC coupling for external feed is possible.

Modulation signals of up to two sources (internal and external source) can be combined for AM/FM and PhiM modulation.

Available internal and external analog modulation modes are:

Frequency modulation (FM)

Amplitude modulation (AM)

Phase modulation (PhiM)

Stereo modulation (Stereo)

Pulse modulation (Pulse)

Note: For modulation modes that can be simultaneously used, refer to the R&S SMB data sheet.

The status display in the block shows the active modulation(s). Use the [TOGGLE ON/ OFF] key to switch the active modulation of the block on or off.
