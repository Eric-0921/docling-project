# Offset
Sets the frequency offset relative to the RF frequency. The frequency offset of a downstream instrument (for example a mixer) is entered.

The entry does not change the value of the RF frequency at the RF output. It only changes the RF frequency displayed in the display header. The value of the RF frequency in the header corresponds to the frequency at the output of the downstream instrument, see also Chapter 4.3.2.1, "RF Frequency vs. RF Output Frequency", on page 138.
