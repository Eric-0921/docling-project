![Picture](#/pictures/261)

To access the "Frequency Modulation" dialog, select "Modulation > Configure > Frequency Modulation" or use the [MENU] key under "Modulation".

In the upper section of the dialog, you can select the modulation source and activate modulation. The modulation source can be selected independently for the different modulation types and the LF output.

The configuration of the selected external and/or internal modulation source is performed in the lower section of the menu (internal source only).

These settings affect all modulations which use the same modulation sources.
