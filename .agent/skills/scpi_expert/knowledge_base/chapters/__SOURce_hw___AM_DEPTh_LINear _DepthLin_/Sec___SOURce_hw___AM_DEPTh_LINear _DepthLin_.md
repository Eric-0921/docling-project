# [:SOURce<hw>]:AM:DEPTh:LINear <DepthLin>
Sets the overall modulation depth of the amplitude modulation in percent.

Note: For high frequency instruments, you can alternatively select exponential amplitude modulation with command [:SOURce<hw>]:AM:TYPE . In this case, the generator sets modulation depth in dB (logarithmic).

For more details, see also the GUI reference, Chapter 4.4.2, "Amplitude Modulation (AM)", on page 204.
