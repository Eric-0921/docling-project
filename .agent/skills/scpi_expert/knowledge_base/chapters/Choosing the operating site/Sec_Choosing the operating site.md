If Rohde & Schwarz provides accessories designed for your product, e.g. a carrying bag, you can use the product outdoors.

Unless otherwise specified, you can operate the product up to an altitude of 2000 m above sea level. The product is suitable for pollution degree 2 environments where nonconductive contamination can occur.
