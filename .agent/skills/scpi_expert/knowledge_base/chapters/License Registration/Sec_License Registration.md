# License Registration
If your purchased license is delivered unregistered, you must register it before you can activate the option.

For detailed information about the license registration, refer to the installation instructions provided with the option (Supplement A) and the documentation of the online tool "Manage Licenses" (https://extranet.rohde-schwarz.com/service).

Only if the R&S SMB is equipped with an older firmware version, a firmware update prior to enabling the software option may be required. The information on the valid firmware versions for the purchased software option is provided together with the option.

The firmware update is described in the service manual, chapter 4.
