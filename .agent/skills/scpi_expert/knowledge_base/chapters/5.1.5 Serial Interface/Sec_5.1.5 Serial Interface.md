# 5.1.5 Serial Interface
Remote control via the serial interface is possible either via RS232 interface or via a Bluetooth connection. The controller/Bluetooth device and the instrument must be connected via an external USB/serial-adapter (see recommended extras, data sheet) and a serial crossover (null modem) cable. A USB connection requires the VISA library to be installed on the controller. VISA detects and configures the R&S SMB automatically when the USB connection is established.
