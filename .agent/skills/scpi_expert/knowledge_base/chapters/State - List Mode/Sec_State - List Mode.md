# State - List Mode
Activates/deactivates the List mode. The currently selected list is processed.

In case of a new or modified list, the necessary hardware settings are automatically determined on activation of the list mode. The data determined in this way is stored along with the list and is available whenever the list is used again.

This means that when activating the list mode, the system checks whether any hardware settings are present. If so, the list is started immediately, but if not they are automatically determined (the list is learnt).

A "Learn List Mode Data" button is available for deliberately activating list learning.

Note: Activating the list mode automatically deactivates all sweeps. During list mode the frequency and level indications do not display the currently set values.
