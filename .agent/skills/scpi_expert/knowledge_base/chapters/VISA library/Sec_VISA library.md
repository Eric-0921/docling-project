# VISA library
Instrument access via VXI-11 or HiSLIP protocols is achieved from high level programming platforms using VISA as an intermediate abstraction layer. VISA encapsulates the low level VXI or GPIB function calls and thus makes the transport interface transparent for the user. See Chapter 5.1.1, "VISA Libraries", on page 241 for details.
