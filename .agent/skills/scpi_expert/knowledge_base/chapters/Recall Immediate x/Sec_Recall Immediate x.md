# Recall Immediate x
Loads the selected configuration from one of the three intermediate memories.

If an instrument setting in which a sweep was activated is saved, the sweep is started when the recall command is called.

If an instrument setting which accesses lists is saved, this list is also loaded.

If the list has been deleted in the meantime, an error message appears when the instrument setting is loaded. If the list has been overwritten in the meantime, the new entries will be used.

A message appears if no instrument configuration is saved in this memory.

Remote command:
