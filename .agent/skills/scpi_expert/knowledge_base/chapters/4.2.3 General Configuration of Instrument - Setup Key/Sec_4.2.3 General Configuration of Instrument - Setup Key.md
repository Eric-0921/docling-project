![Picture](#/pictures/130)

The "Setup" menu provides access to basic instrument settings, regardless of the currently set operating mode or measurement. It contains information on the insstrument's equipment, and comprises all settings for the general configuration of the instrument and its interfaces.

To access the "Setup" menu, press the [SETUP] key.

The "Setup" menu is divided into functional sections as follows:

"System": covers general instrument parameters.

"Test": used to perform function tests.

"Environment": used to configure the controller interfaces.

"Remote": used to configure the remote control interfaces.

"Protection": used to set the protection level for service functions and security settings.

"Settings": used to save or recall instrument settings or to preset the instrument to factory settings.

Most submenus of this key can be accessed only via the [SETUP] key or the menu tree ( [MENU] key), with the following exceptions:

The "Reference Oscillator" dialog can also be accessed in the "RF" block and is therefore described in the section on this block (see Chapter 4.3.4, "Reference Oscillator", on page 142).

The "Save/Recall" dialog can also be accessed with the [FILE] key and is therefore described in the section on this key (see Chapter 4.2.8, "Storing and Loading Instrument Data - File Key", on page 127.
