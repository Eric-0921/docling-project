# 4.3.7.1 Overview
The R&S SMB offers three different sweep types (frequency sweep, level sweep and LF sweep) to be activated alternatively. Each type has 6 modes which differ with respect to the sweep cycle mode (continuous, individual and step-by-step) and triggering mode (automatic, internal and external).

Sweeps and list mode can not be activated simultaneously, they deactivate each other.

Activating a sweep mode immediately disables NRP Level Control. Vice versa, a running sweep mode blocks "NRP Level Control". It can not be activated.

If you want to remain at a specific frequency or level value during a sweep, enter the value directly in the status bar. The sweep stops immediately.
