# Attenuator Mode
Sets the attenuator mode at the RF output.

"Auto"

"Fixed"

Standard mode.

When this operating mode is switched on, the attenuator, relays and amplifier stages are fixed in their current positions to provide level settings without interruption. The resulting variation range is defined and displayed under "Attenuator Fixed Range".

Note: The function is effective when automatic level control is activated ("ALC State = On").

If the normal variation range is overranged or underranged, level errors increase considerably and the warning "Level under/overrange" appears in the info line. The spectral purity of the output signal decreases with high attenuation.
