The files are stored with the fixed file extensions *.lsw in a directory of the user's choice. The directory applicable to the command is defined with the command MMEMory:CDIR . To access the files in this directory, only the file name has to be given, without the path and the file extension. A path can also be specified in command :SOUR:LIST:CAT? , in which case the file in the specified directory is deleted.

*RST does not affect data lists.
