# [:SOURce<hw>]:FREQuency[:CW|FIXed] <Fixed>
Sets the frequency of the RF output signal.

In CW mode, see FREQ:MODE CW|FIXed , the instrument operates at a fixed frequency.

In sweep mode FREQ:MODE SWE , the value applies to the sweep frequency and the instrument processes the frequency settings in defined sweep steps.

You can enter either a numerical frequency value, of decrease or increase the current frequency step by step with FREQ UP and FREQ DOWN . The frequency is then increased or decreased by the value [:SOURce<hw>]:FREQuency:STEP[: INCRement] in FREQ:STEP:MODE USER .
