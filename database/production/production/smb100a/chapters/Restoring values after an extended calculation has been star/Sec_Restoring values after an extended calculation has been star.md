# Restoring values after an extended calculation has been started
Calculation and setting might require different period of time. Many settings are made without noticeable calculation times; such operations are indicated by a "BUSY" message displayed in the status field of the header section.

A window with a progress indicates that the instrument performs an extended calculation that requires longer calculation time. The termination of such a calculation restores the previous values.

Press the [Abort] button to terminate the calculation.

All previous values are restored.
