# The value entered with command
SOUR:LFO:SWE:FREQ:STEP:LIN|LOG sets the step width.

The value entered with command SOUR:LFO:FREQ:MAN has no effect, the command only sets the next sweep step. In remote control only a step-by-step sweep from start to stop frequency is possible.

Generates a single sweep cycle when an a external trigger event occurs.

The sweep steps within the cycle are performed automatically, controlled by the dwell time. If one cycle is completed, the instrument waits for the next trigger event.

To trigger the sweep, apply an external trigger signal.

Refer to the description of the rear panel for information on the connectors for external trigger signal input (see Chapter 3.2.2, "Rear Panel Tour", on page 54).
