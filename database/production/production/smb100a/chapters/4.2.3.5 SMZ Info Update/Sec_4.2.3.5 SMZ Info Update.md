Where you can find the description... Since this section is relevant when an R&S SMZxxx frequency multiplier is connected, you can find a detailed description in the user manual of the frequency multiplier. It is included in the online help of the R&S SMB, but can also be found in pdf format on the CD, or on the R&S website http://www.rohde-schwarz.com/product/ SMZ.html.
