# [:SOURce<hw>]:LIST:SELect <Filename>
Selects the specified list. If a new list is to be created, the name can be entered here. The list is created if it does not yet exist. The list selected here is available for the further processing steps (editing) and is used in the instrument when the list mode is activated.

The files are stored with the fixed file extensions *.lsw in a directory of the user's choice. The directory applicable to the command is defined with the command MMEMory:CDIR . A path can also be specified in which case the list mode file in the specified directory is selected.

*RST does not affect data lists.
