# 3.4.3 Application Field of the Instrument
The main field of application of the R&S SMB is the generation of sine wave signals with very high spectral purity. These signals are needed e.g. for adjacent channel or phase noise measurements. In addition, the RF signal can be modulated with the internal modulations waveforms sine waves and rectangular signals.
