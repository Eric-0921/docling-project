The total cable length is restricted to a maximum of 15 m; the cable length between two instruments should not exceed 2m.

A wired "OR"-connection is used if several instruments are connected in parallel, since the slowest instrument determines the speed.

Any connected IEC bus cable must be terminated by an instrument or controller.
