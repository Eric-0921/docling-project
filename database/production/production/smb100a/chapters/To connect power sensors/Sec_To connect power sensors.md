You can also connect power sensors of the R&S NRP series either directly at the USB interface, or using an USB hub, e.g. R&S NRP-Z5 with several connected power sensors.

For sensors with network capabilitiy, you can use the LAN interface, see

To connect a power senor to the USB type A connector, you have several options:

Connect the sensor to the USB type A connector

If necessary, use an adapter cable, e.g. R&S NRP-Z3 or R&S NRP-Z4

Connect several sensors to an USB hub, and the hub to the R&S SMB.

See Chapter 4.3.6, "RF Measurement", on page 167.
