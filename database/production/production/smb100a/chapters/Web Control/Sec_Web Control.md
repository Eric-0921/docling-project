# Web Control
The web control functionality provides remote operation via VNC using a Web browser (with HTML5). This mode does not require additional installation or activation. The VNC protocol allows simultaneous operation from several remote devices. The instrument remains locally operable.

The GUI of the R&S SMB is visible. To perform the settings, you can operate the instrument as with the manual control. The instrument controls are available via the front panel simulation. File upload and download between the instrument and the remote PC is also available.
