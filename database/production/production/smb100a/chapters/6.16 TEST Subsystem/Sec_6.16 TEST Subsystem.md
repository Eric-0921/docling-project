# 6.16 TEST Subsystem
The TEST system contains the commands for performing selftest routines, and for direct adjustment of the hardware assemblies ( :TEST:DIRect ).

The self tests return a "0" if the test is performed successfully, otherwise a value other than "0" is returned. None of the commands of this system have an *RST value.
