# 5.3 SCPI command structure
SCPI commands consist of a header and, usually, one or more parameters. The headers may consist of several mnemonics (keywords). Queries are formed by appending a question mark directly to the header.

The commands can be either instrument-specific or instrument-independent (common commands). Common and instrument-specific commands differ in their syntax.
