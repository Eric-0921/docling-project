# [:SOURce<hw>]:POWer:STOP <Stop>
Sets the stop level for the RF sweep.

Note: You can select any level within the setting range. The range is defined by the [: SOURce<hw>]:POWer:STARt value and this stop value.

A defined offset ( [:SOURce<hw>]:POWer[:LEVel][:IMMediate]:OFFSet ) affects the level values according to the formula:

Minimum level + OFFSet ... Maximum level + OFFSet
