# 4.2.2 Default Instrument Settings - Preset Key
The [PRESET] key performs a defined instrument setup. All parameters and switching states are preset (also those of inactive operating modes). The default instrument settings provide a reproducible initial basis for further settings.

However, functions concerning the integration of the instrument in a measurement setup are not changed, for example the GPIB address or reference oscillator settings.

When the instrument is switched on, it is not the preset state that is active, but rather the instrument state that was set before the instrument was switched on.

User-defined instrument states can be accessed and stored in the "File" menu.

Resetting the instrument to the factory state is possible with the Factory Preset function.
