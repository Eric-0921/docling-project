# Recall
Loads the selected configuration.

If an instrument setting in which a sweep was activated is saved, the sweep starts when the recall command is called.

If an instrument setting which accesses lists is saved, this list is also loaded.

If the list has been deleted in the meantime, an error message appears when the instrument setting is loaded. If the list has been overwritten in the meantime, the new entries will be used.
