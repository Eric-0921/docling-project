# Factory Preset
Reset the instrument's settings to their factory state.

Note: "Factory Preset" resets the "Remote Channel" and network settings to the default values.

Executing "Factory Preset" via remote control terminates the connection to the instrument, if these settings had been configured to values different to the default ones.

The factory preset function resets nearly all instrument settings. In addition to the regular preset by means of the [PRESET] key, a "Factory Preset" resets also the following values:

Power on settings ("Level/EMF" menu)

Reference frequency settings ("Ref Oscillator" menu)

Network settings including hostname ("Setup" menu)

Start/Stop display update ("Setup" menu)

Remote channel settings including GPIB address ("Setup" menu)

Display and keyboard settings ("Setup" menu).

To maintain security, password settings and all settings protected by these passwords like disabled USB and LAN connections are not changed.

Not affected by the "Factory Preset" are also user data, lists or instrument settings files, created for example by means of the Save/Recall function.
