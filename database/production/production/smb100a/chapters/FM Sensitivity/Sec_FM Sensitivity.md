# FM Sensitivity
Displays the input sensitivity of the externally applied modulation signal at the [MOD EXT] input in Hz/V.

The modulation deviation entered with FM Deviation is achieved with 1 Volt (= U peak ) of the input signal.

Note: The input voltage must not exceed 1.1 V p otherwise modulation distortions occur.
