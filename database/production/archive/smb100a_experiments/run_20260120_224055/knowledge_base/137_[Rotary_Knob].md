# [Rotary_Knob]

[Rotary Knob]

The rotary knob has several functions:

Moves the cursor, e.g. to a function block in the block diagram

Increases (clockwise direction) or decreases (counter-clockwise direction) numeric values at a defined step width in editing mode

Scrolls within lists, tables or tree views

Shifts the selection bar within focused areas (e.g. lists), if the edit mode is activated.

Acts like the [ENTER] key, when it is pressed.

Note: Turning or pressing the rotary knob is equivalent to pressing the [Up] and [Down] keys or the [ENTER] key in the keypad.
