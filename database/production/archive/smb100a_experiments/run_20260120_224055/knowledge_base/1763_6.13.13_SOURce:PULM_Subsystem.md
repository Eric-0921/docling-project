SOURce Subsystem

The LF generator is used as the internal modulation source. The pulse frequency of the internal rectangular signal is therefore set in the SOURce:LFOutput subsystem.

The external signal is input at the [PULSE EXT] connector. The connector can be used as trigger input for internal pulse modulation. The polarity and input impedance of the connector can be selected. The pulse modulation signal is output at the [PULSE VIDEO] connector.
