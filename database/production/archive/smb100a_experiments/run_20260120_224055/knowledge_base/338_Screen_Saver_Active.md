# Screen_Saver_Active

Screen Saver Active

Activates/deactivates the screen-save mode of the display.

If activated, the display including backlight is completely switched off after the elapse of the "Wait Time" when no entries via front panel, external mouse or external keyboard are made.

This mode is recommended for preserving the display especially if the instrument is exclusively operated via remote control.
