OvenCold

The reference oscillator has not yet reached its nominal frequency.

When switching on from the STANDBY mode, the specified frequency accuracy is reached immediately. If the power switch was switched off, the reference oscillator needs some warm-up time to reach its nominal frequency. During this period of time, the output frequency does not yet reach its final value either.
