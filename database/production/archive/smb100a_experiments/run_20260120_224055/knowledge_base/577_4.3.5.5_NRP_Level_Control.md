4.3.5.5 NRP Level Control

With the NRP Level Control function, you can achieve a very stable and accurate RF power supplied to your DUT. With the aid of a downstream control circuit, a CLPC (Closed Loop Power Control), you can detect frequency response characteristics of the used components, such as losses due to cables, modules or components like power amplifiers, and compensate these effects accordingly.
