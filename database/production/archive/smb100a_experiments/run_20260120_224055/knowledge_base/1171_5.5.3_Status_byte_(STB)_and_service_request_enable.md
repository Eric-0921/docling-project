# 5.5.3_Status_byte_(STB)_and_service_request_enable

5.5.3 Status byte (STB) and service request enable register (SRE)

The STatus Byte (STB) is already defined in IEEE 488.2. It provides a rough overview of the instrument status by collecting the pieces of information of the lower registers. A special feature is that bit 6 acts as the sum bit of the remaining bits of the status byte.

The STB is read using the command *STB? or a serial poll.

The STatus Byte (STB) is linked to the Service Request Enable (SRE) register. Each bit of the STB is assigned a bit in the SRE. Bit 6 of the SRE is ignored. If a bit is set in the SRE and the associated bit in the STB changes from 0 to 1, a service request (SRQ) is generated. The SRE can be set using the command *SRE and read using the command *SRE? .
