3.5.1.6 Editors

The R&S SMB provides user-friendly editors for defining lists. Lists containing frequency and level value pairs are used for the list mode and the user-defined level correction.

The lists are saved to files and may thus have any length. The file name of the lists and the directory to which the files are saved are user-selectable. The file prefix is different for each list type and is permanently assigned by the system.

For information about file handling and overview of the automatically assigned file prefixes, refer to Chapter 3.5.1.8, "File Management", on page 86.
