# RF_Level

RF Level

Enters the RF level, considering the level offset (see "RF level vs. RF output level" on page 146).

dBm, dBµV, mV and µV can be used as the level units. The four unit keys are labeled with these units.

Note: The SCPI command sets the level of the "Level" display, i.e. an entered level offset is considered in the level value.
