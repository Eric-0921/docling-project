4.1 Overview of Instrument Functions

This chapter explains the functions of the R&S SMB and the options available in the setting menus. The associated SCPI command is specified for each parameter (where applicable).

The description starts with the general instrument settings which do not directly affect signal generation. The majority of these settings can be accessed by means of frontpanel softkey menus and not by means of function block menus.

The signal generation functions are then described, beginning with the functions which affect the RF signal ("RF" block) and the analog modulations ("Mod" block). The configuration of the modulation generators (LF generators and pulse generator) and of the LF sweep is offered in the "Mod Gen" block. The clock synthesis signal is set in the "Clock Synthesis" block.

The general instrument settings include various functions, such as:

Setting a defined basic setup using the [PRESET] key see Chapter 4.2.2, "Default Instrument Settings - Preset Key", on page 96

Switching from remote control to manual control using the [LOCAL] key see Chapter 4.2.4, "Switching to Manual Control - Local Key", on page 123

Configuring the generator and its interfaces in the "Setup" dialog - e.g. setting the GPIB address, starting an adjustment, querying instrument data see Chapter 4.2.3, "General Configuration of Instrument - Setup Key", on page 97

Calling up the online help using the [HELP] key see Chapter 4.2.7, "Help System - Help Key", on page 126

Querying messages using the [INFO] key see Chapter 4.2.6, "Messages - Info Key", on page 126

Loading and storing complete instrument settings in the "File" menu see Chapter 4.2.8, "Storing and Loading Instrument Data - File Key", on page 127

The RF signal and the reference oscillator are configured in the "RF" function block:

CW mode see Chapter 4.3.1, "Overview of RF Signal", on page 136

List mode see Chapter 4.3.7.4, "List Mode", on page 192

Frequency and Level Sweep mode see Chapter 4.3.7.1, "Overview", on page 178

Reference Oscillator see Chapter 4.3.4, "Reference Oscillator", on page 142

RF Level see Chapter 4.3.5.1, "Overview of RF Level", on page 146

The internal LF generators, the LF frequency sweep and the pulse generator are configured in the "Mod Gen" function block:

LF Frequency Sweep see Chapter 4.5.3, "LF Frequency Sweep", on page 225

LF output see Chapter 4.5.2, "LF Output", on page 224
