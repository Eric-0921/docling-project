# RF_OFF_Mode

RF OFF Mode

Selects the attenuator mode, when the RF signal is switched off.

The setting of the RF OFF mode is not affected by an instrument preset ([PRESET] key), *RST and the "Save/Recall" function. This parameter is influenced only by the Factory Preset.

RF Block

Freezes the setting of the attenuator when RF is switched off. The attenuator is only activated when RF is switched on.

This setting is recommended if a constant VSWR ( V oltage S tanding W ave R atio) is required.

Furthermore, on instruments equipped with a mechanical attenuator, it provides fast and wear-free operation.

"Full Attenuation"

Sets attenuation to maximum when the RF signal is switched off. This setting is recommended for applications that require a high level of noise suppression.
