3.5.1 Manual Operation

The R&S SMB can be operated intuitively either via the interactive block diagram or via a menu tree. All menus are in the form of windows that can be operated in the same way. Rotary knob, keys and softkeys, or alternatively a mouse, allow direct and therefore convenient access to entries and settings.

The display shows the current signal generator state. The embedded online help functions supports you in signal configuration.

This section describes the concept of manual operation of the signal generator. It includes a description of the general structure of a dialog box, working with dialog boxes and the block diagram and the setting of parameters.

For an in-depth description of the instrument functions and dialog boxes, refer to Chapter 4, "Instrument Function", on page 94.
