# Exponential_AM_(Instruments_with_high_frequency_op

Exponential AM (Instruments with high frequency options)

Besides the linear amplitude modulation, whereby the signal voltage is proportional to the modulation signal, instruments equipped with the frequency options (R&S SMBB112(L) /-B120(L) /-B140(L)) provide a level-proportional power or amplitude modulation.

In this case, the R&S SMB exponentially distorts the modulation signal, before it is output at the [LF connector] - regardless of the AM Source Int, or Ext. The AM Depth is then indicated in dB.
