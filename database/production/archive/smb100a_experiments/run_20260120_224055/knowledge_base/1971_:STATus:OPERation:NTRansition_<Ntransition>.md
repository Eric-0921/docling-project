# :STATus:OPERation:NTRansition_<Ntransition>

:STATus:OPERation:NTRansition <Ntransition>

Sets the bits of the NTRansition part of the STATus:OPERation register. If a bit is set, a transition from 1 to 0 in the condition part causes an entry to be made in the EVENt part of the register. The disappearance of an event in the hardware is thus registered, for example the end of an adjustment.
