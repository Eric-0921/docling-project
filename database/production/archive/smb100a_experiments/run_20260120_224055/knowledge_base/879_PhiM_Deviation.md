# PhiM_Deviation

PhiM Deviation

Sets the modulation deviation in RAD.

The maximum deviation depends on the set RF frequency and the selected modulation mode (see data sheet).

If the entered deviation is too high for the set RF frequency, the instrument provides the maximum value and displays an error message. The same applies, if the RF frequency is set to a value, at which the deviation cannot be determined.

The deviation of the internal source must not exceed the deviation of the external source in case of modulation source "Int+Ext".
