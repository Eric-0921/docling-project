# Internal_Modulation_Sources

Internal Modulation Sources

An LF generator and a pulse generator are available as internal modulation sources for a fully equipped instrument. The LF generator supplies sinusoidal or rectangular signals.

The optional pulse generator (option R&S SMB-K27) provides single and double pulse modulation with selectable pulse widths and periods or a user-definable pulse train.

See also Chapter 4.5.1, "Overview of LF Generator", on page 223.
