# [:SOURce<hw>]:PM:EXTernal:DEViation_<Deviation>

[:SOURce<hw>]:PM:EXTernal:DEViation <Deviation>

Sets the modulation deviation of the external phase modulation signal in RAD. The maximum value depends on the set RF frequency and the selected modulation mode (see data sheet).

The sum of the deviations of all active frequency modulation signals may not exceed the total value set with command [:SOURce<hw>]:PM:EXTernal:DEViation .
