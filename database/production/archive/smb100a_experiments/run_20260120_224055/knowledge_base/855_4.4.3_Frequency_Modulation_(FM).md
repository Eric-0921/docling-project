4.4.3 Frequency Modulation (FM)

An internal and/or external source can be selected for frequency modulation. The LF GEN modulation generator is available as the internal source. Two-tone FM is possible by simultaneously switching on the external and internal source.

The [MOD EXT] input connectors for external feed of analog modulation signals are at the front of the instrument. The coupling mode of the input (AC or DC) can be selected.

Selection between three modulation modes is possible:

"Normal" mode with full setting range for modulation bandwidth and FM deviation.

"Low Noise" mode with better signal/noise ratio, but reduced setting range for modulation bandwidth

"High Deviation" mode with full setting range for FM deviation and a reduced setting range for modulation bandwidth (see data sheet).

Modulation

It is not possible to use frequency modulation simultaneously with phase modulation.

See "Simultaneous Operation of Several Modulations or Other Operating Modes" on page 203 for an overview in detail.
