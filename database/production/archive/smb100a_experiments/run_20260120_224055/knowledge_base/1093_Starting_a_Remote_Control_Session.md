Starting a Remote Control Session

Note: If the connection cannot be set up, R&S VISA displays an error in the log view. For information on how to proceed when network failures occur, see Chapter 9.5, "Resolving network connection failures", on page 505.

For further information on the functions to read and write to an open session, as well as the utility applications the software provides, see the R&S VISA User Manual.
