# 4.5.2_LF_Output

4.5.2 LF Output

To open the "LF Generator / Output" dialog, select "Mod Gen > Configure > LF Generator / Output" or use the [MENU] key under "Mod Gen".

The dialog provides access to the configuration of the internal modulation generators, and you can activate the output of the LF signal

The available settings depend on the source selected and on the installed options. Alternatively, you can perform the settings also in the correpsonding dialogs of the analog modulations, like "Amplitude Modulation". The configured LF signal applies to all modulations which use the internal modulation sources, and to the LF output.
