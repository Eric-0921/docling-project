# Use_computer_names_to_identify_the_instrument

Use computer names to identify the instrument

In networks using a DHCP server, it is recommended that you address the instrument by its unambiguous computer name, see Chapter 3.1.15.2, "Using Computer Names", on page 31.

A computer name ( hostname ) is an unique dedicated identification of the instrument, that remains permanent as long as it is not explicitly changed. Hence, you can address an instrument by the same identification (computer name), irrespectively if a network or a point-to-point connection is used.
