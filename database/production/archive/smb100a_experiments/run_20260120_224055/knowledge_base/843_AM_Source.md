# AM_Source

AM Source

Selects the source for the AM modulation signal.

"Internal"

Uses the internal LF generator as modulation signal source for AM.

"External"

"Intern + Extern"

Uses an externally applied modulation signal.

The external signal is input via the [MOD EXT] connector.

Uses both, the internal and externally applied modulation signal, for example to perform two-tone AM.

Note: This setting applies to linear AM, see "Exponential AM (Instruments with high frequency options)" on page 204.
