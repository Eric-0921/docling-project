# Offset_(Level)

Offset (Level)

Sets the level offset relative to the RF level.

The level offset of a downstream instrument (for example an attenuator or amplifier) is entered.

The entry does not change the value of the RF level at the RF output. It only changes the RF level displayed in the display header. The value of the RF level in the header corresponds to the level at the output of the downstream instrument.
