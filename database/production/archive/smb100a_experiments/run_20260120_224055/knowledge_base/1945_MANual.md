# MANual

MANual

The trigger system is not active. Each level step of the sweep is triggered individually, either by varying the "Current Level" value using the rotary knob under manual control or by means of a POW:MAN command under remote control.

With manual control, the level increases or decreases (depending on the direction of the rotary encoder) by the value specified under SOUR:SWE:POW:STEP . With remote control, the level increases by the value specified under SWEep:POW:STEP which each sent :POW:MAN command, irrespective the value entered there.
