# Workgroup

Workgroup

Sets the individual windows workgroup name of the R&S SMB. This parameter is required in case the instrument is integrated in a windows network.

Note: Since the workgroup name of the instrument is a protected parameter, you must first unlock protection level 1 to enable the entry (see Chapter 4.2.3.13, "Protection", on page 113).

Remote command:

:SYSTem:COMMunicate:NETWork[:COMMon]:WORKgroup on page 445
