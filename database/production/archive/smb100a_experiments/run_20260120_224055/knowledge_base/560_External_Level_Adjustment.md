# External_Level_Adjustment

External Level Adjustment

The external level adjustment provides information about the data that has been used for calibrating the RF level.

By default the instrument uses correction data obtained in the factory before delivery. In exceptional cases, you can determine the calibration values with an R&S NRP power sensor, and use these values for the external level correction. This feature is a protected function (see Service Manual, chapter 2, "Adjustment").
