# Securing_the_display

Securing the display

To prevent unauthorized personnel from reading the display, you can disable the frequency and level display explicitly. This is useful when you remotely control the instrument from a different location.

For information on how to disable the frequency and level display, refer to "Annotation Frequency" on page 119 and "Annotation Amplitude" on page 119.

Refer to Chapter 5.2.3, "Examples", on page 250 for practical examples on setting up of a remote control link and starting of a remote control session.
