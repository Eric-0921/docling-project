# [:SOURce<hw>]:FM:SENSitivity?

[:SOURce<hw>]:FM:SENSitivity?

Queries the input sensitivity of the externally applied signal for frequency modulation. The returned value reports the sensitivity in Hz/V. It is assigned to the voltage value for full modulation of the input signal.

The sensitivity depends on the set [:SOURce<hw>]:FM[:DEViation] .
