Use the "File Type" to select a file type from the list. This can be used to process either all files (all files ( * ) selection) or a specific selection of files. See "Extensions for User Files" on page 89 for an overview of the supported file extensions. The available drives and directories and the files of the selected directory are displayed. The currently selected path is displayed above the windows. If the area is opened several times, the path last selected is displayed. Unlike the "File Select" window, the "File Manager" displays the full file names including extensions.
