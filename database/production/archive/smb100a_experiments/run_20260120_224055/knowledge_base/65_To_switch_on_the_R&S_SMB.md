Getting Started

Press the [ON/STANDBY] key at the front panel.

The LED changes to green. The R&S SMB boots.

When starting for the first time, the R&S SMB starts with the default settings. When restarting the instrument, the settings depend on the instrument configuration before shut-down.

See Chapter 4.2.8, "Storing and Loading Instrument Data - File Key", on page 127.

When the instrument is switched on, it automatically monitors main functions.

A detected fault is indicated by an "ERROR" message displayed in the info line together with a brief error description. For in-depth identification of the error, press the [INFO] key. In response, a description of the error(s) is displayed. In addition to automatic monitoring, you can perform maintenance tasks.
