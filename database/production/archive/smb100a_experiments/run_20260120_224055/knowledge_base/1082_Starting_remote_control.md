# Starting_remote_control

Starting remote control

Send a command from a controller to the instrument.

The instrument changes to remote state as soon as it receives the command from the controller.

Note: If you have sent &NREN before, the automatic transition from local state to manual control by a subsequent remote command is disabled (use &GTR to enable it again).

In remote state, operation via the front panel or via mouse and keyboard is disabled. The status line indicates the "REMOTE" state.
