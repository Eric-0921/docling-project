The dialog lists all detected R&S NRP sensors for selection and mapping. You can also browse the network for sensors.

The detected sensors are characterized by the used protocol and the corresponding connector icon. In the "Mapping" column, you can assign the sensor to one of the available sensor channels. The list can contain several entries but the R&S SMB can only use up to four sensors simultaneously.

The remote commands required to define these settings are described in Chapter 6.12, "SENSe, READ and INITiate Subsystems", on page 318.
