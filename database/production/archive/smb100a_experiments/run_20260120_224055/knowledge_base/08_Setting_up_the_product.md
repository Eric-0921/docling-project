# Setting_up_the_product

Setting up the product

Always place the product on a stable, flat and level surface with the bottom of the product facing down. If the product is designed for different positions, secure the product so that it cannot fall over.

If the product has foldable feet, always fold the feet completely in or out to ensure stability. The feet can collapse if they are not folded out completely or if the product is moved without lifting it. The foldable feet are designed to carry the weight of the product, but not an extra load.

If stacking is possible, keep in mind that a stack of products can fall over and cause injury.

If you mount products in a rack, ensure that the rack has sufficient load capacity and stability. Observe the specifications of the rack manufacturer. Always install the products from the bottom shelf to the top shelf so that the rack stands securely. Secure the product so that it cannot fall off the rack.
