# Keys_with_assigned_simple_functions

Keys with assigned simple functions

Most keys on the front panel of the R&S SMB directly perform a simple function.

Since a great number of settings can thus be made by a keystroke, operation is easy. For instance, the [CLOSE] (ESC) key closes the active menu; with the [RF ON/OFF] (CTRL+R) key the RF output signal can be switched on or off.
