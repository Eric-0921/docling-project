4.4.6 Stereo Modulation

Options R&S SMB-B5, Stereo/RDS Coder enables generation of stereo-modulated RF signals according to standard. Beside the MPX (FM stereo multiplex) signal, also the radio traffic service ARI (Automotive Radio Information) and Radio Data System (RDS) are supported by the option.

An internal or external source can be selected for the audio signal of the stereo modulation. In case of external source, the external signal is input via the analog [L] and [R] inputs or via the digital [S/P DIF] interface at the rear of the instrument. In case of internal source, the LF generator is used. Measurements can be performed in the operating modes L and R, and L = R, L = -R and R!=L (ext. signals only).

A typical setup with the R&S SMB with the option Stereo/RDS Coder in connection with the Audio Analyzer UPV is shown in the following graph.
