# [:SOURce<hw>]:PM:INTernal:DEViation_<Deviation>

[:SOURce<hw>]:PM:INTernal:DEViation <Deviation>

Sets the deviation of the internal phase modulation signal in RAD.

The sum of the deviations of all active frequency modulation signals may not exceed the total value set with command [:SOURce<hw>]:PM[:DEViation] .
