Terminating VNC Connection

The remote access via VNC connection can be terminated either on the R&S SMB or on the external PC. Terminating the connection does not disable it. It can be established again any time. See the notice above concerning unauthorized access due to VNC connection!

Terminate the connection on the R&S SMB

Press the "Windows" key to access the operating system.

Right-click on the VNC icon on the task bar and select "Kill all clients".

To terminate the connection on the external Linux/Unix PC, close the internet browser or close the signal generator window.

To terminate the connection on the external Windows PC, close the VNC Viewer program.

The connection is terminated. The color of the VNC icon in the status bar of the instrument changes.

A message on the external PC indicates the disconnection.
