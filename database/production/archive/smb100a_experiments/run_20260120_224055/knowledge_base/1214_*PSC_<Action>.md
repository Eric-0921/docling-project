*PSC <Action>

Power on status clear

Determines whether the contents of the ENABle registers are preserved or reset when the instrument is switched on. Thus a service request can be triggered when the instrument is switched on, if the status registers ESE and SRE are suitably configured. The query reads out the contents of the "power-on-status-clear" flag.
