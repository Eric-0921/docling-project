# Return_values:

Return values:

<Sensitivity>

float

Example:

PM:DEV 1

sets a modulation deviation of 1RAD.

PM:SENS?

queries the input sensitivity at the external modulation input.

Response: 1

since the voltage value for full modulation is 1V, the resulting sensitivity is precisely 1RAD/V.

Usage:

Query only

Manual operation:

See "PhiM Sensitivity" on page 214
