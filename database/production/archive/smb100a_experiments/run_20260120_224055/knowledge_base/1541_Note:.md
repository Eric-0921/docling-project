# Note:

Note:

A defined offset and the multiplier factor affect the sweep range and therefore all correlated parameters. The set frequencies are only absolute values, if the offset = 0 and the multiplication factor = 1. The multiplier multiplies the frequencies accordingly, and the offset ≠ 0 shifts the frequencies corresponding to the set value.

SOURce Subsystem

The actual frequency at the RF output does not change, but rather the value queried with [:SOUR]:FREQ? , according to the formula:

f FREQ = f RFout * f MULTiplier + f OFFSet

Correlation : FREQ for FREQ:MODE SWE is linked to the sweep frequency.
