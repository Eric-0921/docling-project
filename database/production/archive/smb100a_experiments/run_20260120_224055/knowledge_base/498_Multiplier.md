# Multiplier

Multiplier

Sets the multiplication factor for the RF frequency.

In the frequency field of the status bar, the instrument adjusts its frequency display according to the set multiplication factor. This frequency value shows the frequency at the output of the downstream multiplier. The entry does not change the RF frequency at the RF output of the R&S SMB, see also Chapter 4.3.2.1, "RF Frequency vs. RF Output Frequency", on page 138.
