5.2.2 Returning to Manual Operation

Before returning to manual control, command processing must be completed. Otherwise, the instrument switches back to remote control immediately.

To return to manual operation, perform one of the following:

Press the [LOCAL] key on the front panel.

Select "Setup > Remote Control Channels > Local".

While using the socket communication, terminate the remote control session.

Send the interface command &GTL via the remote control interface.

Use the &GTR to enable the [LOCAL] key if it is locked.
