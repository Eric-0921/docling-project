4.5.1 Overview of LF Generator

The internal modulation generator of the instrument provides a sinusodial or rectangular LF modulation signal without additional equipment options. The corresponding key data, as for example the frequency range, is specified under "Modulation sources" in the data sheet.

You can use the internal LF signal as modulation signal source for the analog modulations, as for example the amplitude modulation. The signal applies to all modulations which are using the internal modulation signal. Therefore, any modification of the LF signal impacts all currently active modulations immediately.

To configure the LF generator signal, see Chapter 4.5.2.1, "LF Output Dialog", on page 224. However, you can also configure the LF signal directly in the settings dialogs of the analog modulations.

Optionally, the instrument provides the following modulation sources:

Pulse Generator (option R&S SMB-K23) for generating single and double pulse signals, see Chapter 4.5.4, "Pulse Generator", on page 231.

High-performance pulse generator (option R&S SMB-K27) for generating pulse train signals.

The R&S SMB also provides the configured LF signal at the corresponding output connector, for example as modulation signal source for interconnected instruments.
