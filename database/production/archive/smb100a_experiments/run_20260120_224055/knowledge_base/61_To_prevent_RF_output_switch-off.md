# To_prevent_RF_output_switch-off

To prevent RF output switch-off

NOTICE! If you set a too high output level without a load connected to the instrument, the reverse power can exceed a limit forcing the R&S SMB to switch off the RF output.

Connect a load with sufficient return loss as given in the data sheet.
