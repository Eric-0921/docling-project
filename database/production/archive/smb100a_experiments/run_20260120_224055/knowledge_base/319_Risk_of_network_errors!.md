# Risk_of_network_errors!

Risk of network errors!

Connection errors can affect the entire network.

If your network does not support DHCP, or if you choose to disable dynamic TCP/IP configuration, you must assign valid address information before connecting the instrument to the LAN.

Contact your network administrator to obtain a valid IP address.

To access this dialog, press the [setup] or [menu] key and select "Environment > Network Settings".
