:TRIGger<hw>[:SWEep]:SOURce <Source>

Sets the trigger source for all sweeps.

The names of the parameters correspond directly to the various settings under manual control. SCPI uses other names for the parameters; these names are also accepted by the instrument. The SCPI names should be used if compatibility is an important consideration.

An overview of the various names is given in the Table 6-2.
