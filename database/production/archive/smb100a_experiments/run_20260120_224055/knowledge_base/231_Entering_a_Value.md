# Entering_a_Value

Entering a Value

Numeric and alphanumeric values can be edited in the entry fields. In the editing mode, cursors of different colour are used. A blue cursor indicates the overwrite mode, a green cursor the insert mode.

Numeric and alphanumeric values can either be newly entered or the existing value can be changed. Incorrect entries are cleared with the [BACKSPACE] key.
