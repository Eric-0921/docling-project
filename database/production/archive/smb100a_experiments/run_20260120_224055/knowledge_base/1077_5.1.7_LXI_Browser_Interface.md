LAN extension for instrumentation (LXI) is an instrumentation platform for measuring instruments and test systems that is based on standard Ethernet technology.

See Chapter 3.1.17, "LXI Configuration", on page 39.

The LXI browser interface allows easy configuration of the LAN and remote control of the R&S SMB without additional installation requirements. The instrument's LXI browser interface works correctly with all W3C compliant browsers.

The LAN settings are configured using the LXI Browser Interface of the R&S SMB described in Chapter 3.1.17.2, "LAN Configuration", on page 42. The LXI status settings in the R&S SMB are described in Chapter 4.2.3.12, "LXI Status", on page 112.
