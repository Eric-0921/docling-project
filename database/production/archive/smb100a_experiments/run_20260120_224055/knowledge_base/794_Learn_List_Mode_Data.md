# Learn_List_Mode_Data

Learn List Mode Data

Starts the determination of the hardware setting for the selected list. The data determined in this way is stored along with the list.

It may be necessary to deliberately activate list learning in the event of greatly altered environmental conditions that require new hardware settings.

If this is not done, a previously learned hardware setting will continue to be used when list mode is switched on ("State = On"). If no setting is available, e.g. when the list is used for the first time, learning is automatically activated.
