4.4.2 Amplitude Modulation (AM)

An internal and/or external source can be selected for amplitude modulation. The LF modulation generator is available as the internal source.

Two-tone AM is possible by simultaneously switching on the external and internal source.

The [MOD EXT] input connector for external feed of analog modulation signals is at the front of the instrument. The coupling mode of the input (AC or DC) can be selected.

The AM modulation depth is limited by the maximum peak envelope power (PEP).
