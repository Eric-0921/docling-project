# Example:

Example:

HCOP:ITEM ALL ;: HCOP:IMM

This command line contains two commands. Both commands are part of the HCOP command system, i.e. they have one level in common.

If the successive commands belong to the same system, having one or several levels in common, the command line can be abbreviated. When abbreviating the command line, the second command begins with the level below HCOP. The colon after the semicolon is omitted. The abbreviated form of the command line reads as follows:

HCOP:ITEM ALL ; IMM
