Continuing the adjustment process on error occurs

Per default, if any error occurs during the adjustment process, the process aborts. An error message appears in the "Info" line.

If you want to continue the adjustments also if there is an error, proceed as follows:

Press the [setup] key.

Select "Protection > Protection".

Unlock protection level 1, see Chapter 4.2.3.13, "Protection", on page 113.

In the setup menu, select "System > Internal Adjustments".

Select "Continue Adjustment on Error > On".

Proceed as described in "How to execute internal adjustments" on page 496.
