# To_connect_to_LAN

To connect to LAN

The "LAN" connector is at the rear panel.

Connect the LAN socket with an RJ-45 cable to the LAN.

By default, the R&S SMB is configured to use DHCP (dynamic host configuration protocol) and no static IP address is configured.

If switched on and connected to the LAN, you can find the address information in the network settings dialog.

See Chapter 4.2.3.8, "Network Settings", on page 104
