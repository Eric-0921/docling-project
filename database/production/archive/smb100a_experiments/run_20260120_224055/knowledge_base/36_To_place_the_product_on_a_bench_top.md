# To_place_the_product_on_a_bench_top

To place the product on a bench top

Place the product on a stable, flat and level surface. Ensure that the surface can support the weight of the product. For information on the weight, see the data sheet.

CAUTION! Foldable feet can collapse. See "Setting up the product" on page 14. Always fold the feet completely in or out. With folded-out feet, do not place anything on top or underneath the product.

WARNING! A stack of products can fall over and cause injury. Never stack more than three products on top of each other. Instead, mount them in a rack. Stack as follows:

If the products have foldable feet, fold them in completely.

It is best if all products have the same dimensions (width and length). If the products have different dimensions, stack according to size and place the smallest product on top.

Do not exceed the permissible total load placed on the product at the bottom of the stack:

-50 kg when stacking products of identical dimensions (left figure).

-25 kg when stacking smaller products on top (middle figure).
