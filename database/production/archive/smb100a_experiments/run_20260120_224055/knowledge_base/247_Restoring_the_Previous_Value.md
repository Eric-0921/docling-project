# Restoring_the_Previous_Value

Restoring the Previous Value

Parameter variations with the rotary knob are immediately set and therefore not reversible.

Normally, values cannot be restored in the case of mouse control because no explicit confirmation is required in this case and entries are automatically confirmed when the entry or selection field is exited.
