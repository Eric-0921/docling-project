Modulation Generator and LF Output

Requires option R&S SMB-K27.

A user-defined pulse train is generated. Additional settings for the pulse train are available in the menu after selection of the pulse train mode (see Chapter 4.5.4.2, "Pulse Train Generation", on page 235). A pulse train is a sequence of pulses with user-defined on and off times. The on-time/off-time value pairs are defined in a pulse train list. The currently used pulse train file is displayed in the sub menu.
