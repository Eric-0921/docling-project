Getting Started

Preparing for Use

A dialog is opened and the password for the remote VNC connection is requested.

Enter the password as defined in the "Default Local System Properties" panel of the Ultr@VNC program and select "Log On".

The connection is established, the instrument is remote accessed and the current signal generator screen with the block diagram is displayed. The individual functions are operated using the mouse and keyboard.

In contrast to remote access via Remote Desktop, the direct control of the instrument is not disabled and the instrument can be controlled from the front panel and via the remote computer alternately.
