5.2.3.1 Remote Control over GPIB

The program example in this section is written in VISUAL BASIC. A condition for programming in VISUAL BASIC is that the modules NIGLOBAL ( Niglobal.bas ) and VBIB32 ( Vbib_32.bas ) are added to the projects.

Drivers for instrument, e.g. IVI-COM and LabVIEW drivers, are available in the download area of the product website (http://www.rohde-schwarz.com/en/products/ test_and_measurement/product_categories/signal_generation/).
