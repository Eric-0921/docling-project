# Mod_Ext_Coupling

Mod Ext Coupling

Selects the coupling mode ("AC" or "DC") for the external modulation signal.

Note: Coupling for external feed via input [MOD EXT] can be set independently for all modulations using the external modulation signal.

"AC"

Disconnects the DC voltage component and uses only the AC com- ponent of the modulation signal.

"DC"

Uses the modulation signal with both components, AC and DC.

Remote command:
