Volatile messages

Brief messages report automatic settings in the instrument (e.g. switching off of incompatible types of modulation) or on illegal entries that are not accepted by the instrument (e.g. range violations). They are displayed in the info line on a yellow background. They are displayed on top of status information or permanent messages.

Volatile messages do not normally demand user actions and disappear automatically after a brief period of time. They are stored in the history, however.

These messages can be read from remote using the commands :SYSTem:ERRor[: NEXT]? and :SYSTem:ERRor:ALL? .
