# 6.10_MMEMory_subsystem

6.10 MMEMory subsystem

The MMEMory subsystem ( M ass Mem ory) contains the commands for managing files and directories as well as for loading and storing complete instrument settings in files.

The files are stored on the internal flash memory of the instrument or on external USB memory devices.

The /var/user/ directory can be used to save user-defined data; any subdirectory structure can be created on /var/user/ . Some default subdirectories are predefined, but can be changed at any time.

The default directory is determined using the command MMEMory:CDIR .

Use the command :SYSTem:MMEMory:PATH:USER? to query the path of the directory for user-defined data.

The /opt directory is a protected and therefore a not accessible system directory. The files on this directory contain data that must not be changed. Therefore, this directory should not be accessed, since reconstruction of the system partition will lead to data loss.
