# Shape

Shape

Selects the waveform shape of the sweep signal.

"Sawtooth"

The sweep runs from the start to the stop frequency. Each subsequent sweep starts at the start frequency, that means the shape of the sweep sequence resembles a sawtooth.

"Triangle"

The sweep runs from start to stop frequency and back, that means the shape of the sweep resembles a triangle. A subsequent sweep starts at the start frequency.
