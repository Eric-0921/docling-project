Working with Units

The unit of a parameter is displayed next to the value. When the parameter is edited, the unit is selected either from the list or by means of the front-panel keys. When the entry is completed, the unit can be changed. In this case the value remains unchanged but is automatically adapted to the new unit.

While operating the instrument by means of a mouse, assign the unit to the selected parameter before entering its value.
