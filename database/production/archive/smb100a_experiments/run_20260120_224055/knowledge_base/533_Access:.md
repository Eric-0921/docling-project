The offset-free level, level offset and level limit are set in the top section of the dialog. The attenuator mode is set in the "Attenuator Settings" section.

In section "User Variation", you can determine the step size for adjusting the level with the rotary knob (with "Variation Active On").

The power-on behavior of the instrument and the level display in the display header are set in the "Power-On / EMF Settings" section (see Chapter 4.3.5.3, "Power-On/EMF Settings", on page 153).

The remote commands required to define the settings are described in Chapter 6.13.12, "SOURce:POWer Subsystem", on page 382.
