# ●_Output-Queue

● Output-Queue

The output queue contains the messages the instrument returns to the controller. It is not part of the status reporting system but determines the value of the MAV bit in the STB and thus is represented in the overview.

Error- /Event-Queue

The error-/event-queue contains all errors and events that have occurred in the past. When reading the queue, the instrument starts with the first occurred error/ event.

All status registers have the same internal structure.
