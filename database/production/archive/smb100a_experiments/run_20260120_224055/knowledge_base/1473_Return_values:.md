# Return_values:

Return values:

<Sensitivity>

float

Range:

0  to  100

Example:

AM:DEPT 50

sets a modulation depth of 50 %.

AM:SENS?

queries the input sensitivity at the external modulation input.

Response: 50

since the voltage value for full modulation is 1V, the resulting sensitivity is precisely 50 %/V.

Usage:

Query only

Manual operation:

See "AM Sensitivity" on page 206
