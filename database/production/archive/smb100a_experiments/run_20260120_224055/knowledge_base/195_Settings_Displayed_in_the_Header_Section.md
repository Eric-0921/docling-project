# Settings_Displayed_in_the_Header_Section

Settings Displayed in the Header Section

Frequency/level settings and a few status messages (see "Status Information and Messages" on page 72) are displayed in the header field of the screen. The display may vary depending on the instrument's operating mode:

In the sweep mode, the current frequency or level of the output signal is displayed. The status message "SweepMode" is displayed in the info line.

In the list mode, neither the current frequency nor level is displayed, the indication is dimmed.

If user correction is active, the status message "UCorr" is displayed in the info line.

The values displayed in the "Freq" and "Level" fields include a set offset or multiplier factor.

For more See alos Chapter 4.3.2, "RF Frequency", on page 138 and Chapter 4.3.5.1, "Overview of RF Level", on page 146.

The frequency and level indication can be enlarged so that it covers the complete display of the R&S SMB by using the [DIAGR] key. This key toggles between block diagram, magnified frequency and level indication and the display of the active dialog. This requires the "Summary Screen Toggle" to be enabled.
