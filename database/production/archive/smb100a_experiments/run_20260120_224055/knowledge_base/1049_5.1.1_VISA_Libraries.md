5.1.1 VISA Libraries

VISA is a standardized software interface library providing input and output functions to communicate with instruments. Thus, you can configure the interface and must not adjust the application program to the used interface. The I/O channel (LAN or TCP/IP, USB, GPIB,

Instrument access via VXI-11 or HiSLIP protocols is achieved from high level programming platforms using VISA as an intermediate abstraction layer. VISA encapsulates the low-level VXI or GPIB function calls and thus makes the transport interface transparent for the user.

A VISA installation is a prerequisite for remote control using the following interfaces:

LAN Interface using Chapter 5.1.3, "LAN Interface", on page 242

LAN interface using Chapter 5.1.3.2, "VXI-11 protocol", on page 244

Chapter 5.1.4, "USB Interface", on page 245

Chapter 5.1.6, "GPIB Interface (IEC/IEEE Bus Interface)", on page 246

Chapter 5.1.5, "Serial Interface", on page 246

Instrument access via the LAN socket protocol or GPIB connections can be operated both, with or without the VISA library.

See also Chapter 5.1.3.3, "Socket communication", on page 244 and Chapter 5.1.6, "GPIB Interface (IEC/IEEE Bus Interface)", on page 246.

For more information about VISA, refer to the user documentation.
